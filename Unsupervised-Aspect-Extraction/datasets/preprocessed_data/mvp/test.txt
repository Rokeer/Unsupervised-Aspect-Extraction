cost buy stuff people proverty well u people bay area pay .
also stuff need n't really expensive .
people might want help , well fee people proverty n't get help ?

people might also say helping one village time wo n't fast enough .
n't help one village time chip help place .
people might also say n't help .
well one thing 's selfish .
also want proverty gone atleast help alittle .
chip donate organization help end proverty proverty probobly gone 50 year .
another way start organization people get donation help people need get food , medicine , farming equipment , school supply .
help way end proverty tthe twenty second centry .
based article , think 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
' halfway goal time already accomplished lot .
hospital gone expensive stock certain medication free medicine common disease .
medicine went hard get free , probably saved hundred life .
hospital also water electricity , luxury n't .
millennium village project also helped increase food supply technology .
farmer n't fertilizer irrigation , crop always dying .
, proper fertilization irrigation , saved family starving .
child also proper education .
future generation thing , continue process winning fight poverty .
already food , water , electricity , medication , education , basically already poverty .
poverty kenya think think 's important know bad make world better place live .

farmer 's could successful crop 's dying fertilizer help stay alive .
scared wo n't food family 's survive .
provided fertilizer , seed 's tool 's farmer 's .
child school n't many supplie 's .
many book 's paper pencil 's even though child eager learn hard .
also n't lunch day , school fee 's serve lunch .
last exsample : hospital 's n't medicine save cure live 's needed survive hospital medicine cure child charge medicine common disease .
water connected hospital generator electricity .
bed net 's used every sleeping site suari .
goal 's set 2015 set 2025 believed going make difference town 's exactly worked together change poverty area , n't easy
, sauri 's progress proved fight poverty acheiveable lifetime .
author convinced could make difference save people sauri , .
opinion millenium village project millennium village project started , kenya another country blown away poverty , child tattered clothing running around barefoot , woman ground selling banana , n't believe healthy thing .
malaria big problem .
many child suffered died many adult got sick .
tragic hear many people suffering .
another problem hospital overcrowded , 3 child bed 2 adult bed , people ca n't even get help .
running water electricity dark , noone could wash .
millennium village project started , set target goal poverty gone , good .
started making bed net chemical last 5 year almost nobody get malaria , plus bed net five dollar almost affordable anyone .
school fee child could go school , book , pencil , supply need .
also midday lunch student could eat .
attendance rate really high .
lot change make life better lot village .
even electricity running water hospital .
make easier win fight poverty .
134501y2_ 000491918 think author really convinced change poverty destroy .

therefore , did't grow much crop , mostly died , one important thing , growing well .
sauri mostly lack money dont get much kenya , yeah , 's amazing 4 year , improve poor village , good , moderate moving socociety today .
agree proverty eliminated life time .
poor & rich people different kind people .

without thing , farmer would never know many edible crop would produced harvest .
therefore , would left worrying wondering would enough money feed family .
unfortunately , disease malaria n't uncommon village .
without misquito net , many child would die disease .
since people sauri n't enough money keep nice hospital , almost hope people caught disease .
people sauri also well educated .
school , family either n't enough money , needed child help home .
also lacking school supply .
child tried learn material , made hard learn .

hospital eletricity , water , medicine .
went meant probably going die .
people millennium project steped gave power generator , free medicine , connected water building .
school lunch period , low amount educational supply many could afford go .
people millennium progect stepped .
gave enough food lunch , enough school supply , like book pencil , school longer needed fee kid could learn free .
village 's agriculture also bad project .
needed water crop would n't wither , needed fertilizer crop would grow better .
four year support millennium project enough food water everyone village .

's convincing , 's anything .
winning fight poverty achievable ?
hook connects thesis thesis winning poverty .
believe author convinced winning fight poverty achievable great struggle come new life people come help .
2004 sachs went hospital kenya , saw terrible thing .
example , 'the hospital packed patient could n't get treatment either n't could n't afford .
' ( 4 ) explains even though patient , could n't get treated money limited supply .
connects thesis people poverty .
went farm , also disaster .
example , 'their crop dying could n't afford necessary fertilizer & irrigation .
' ( 7 ) meant family could starve & get sick .
connects thesis poverty .
millennium village project created united nation helped kenya .
progress 4 year amazing , people living better .
example , 'hospitals water & electricity , home food net , & school fee & serve lunch .
' ( 7 ) mean united nation provided people kenya everything needed .
live little struggle & happiness .
assert poverty crushed others give time help & create better life .
writing , said people kenya struggling life united nation came .
conclude everybody struggle life , end always another person pick & lift weight shoulder .
fighting poverty difficult task sauri , place well .
order end poverty , must get money country , n't think people know poor place world .
article listed example sauri 's economy , also said within year able improve economy .
set goal around 10 year , n't think 's enough time end poverty .
according article , '20,000 kid die disease day .
' state around 20,000 kid die maleria every day .
's lot people !
kid die , adult also go crisis .
one way treat horrible disease would use bed net .
bet net able save million live , yet costly people unable afford .
solution fighting maleria simple u , possibly impossible people sauri .
another crisis people sauri face would school fee .
believe child able walk school use much utencils want learn much possible get ready future .
sadly , child sauri unable due limited supply expensive school fee .
student want learn unable since 's hard concentrate n't get midday meal , therefore would n't enough energy class .
really hard living sauri .
top numerous death day bed education , unpleasant place live .
woman sit dusty ground sell banana .
little kid would wear tattered clothes walk around barefoot , banana dusty ground may spread bacteria tattered clothes would cause child catch cold .
reason believe ending poverty difficult task , may take 10 year .
impossible task , since many improvement overtime .
people determined help sauri , poverty would end time .
, still lot , many place need help end poverty .
yes , artical convince winning fight poverty time artical say knowledge one important thing need know .
another example going achieve winning war lifetime food water 'll need wife child .
pack food store untill war prepared take wont worry packing last minute 2015 .
next example medicine .
'll need medicine malaria disease going around killing kid getting adult ill/sick .
since artical said hospital good like bed normaly fit 3 kid 2 adult .
11 year war come try acheive goal make better hospital .
another thing artical said power electricity bad always going acheive goal get neither new lightbulb get solar power energy system power use le electricity .
since 11 year acheive goal let try make change make better life prepare fight proverty !
convinced winning fight agains poverty achievable lifetime .
author tell millennium village tryign end kenya 's poverty , goal set year away .
many people make see end poverty .
also mean people important fo reachign gaol lost le progress made .
believe many small goal , nd different people assigned different task , would assured important goal would met .
author also told visited hospital , good shape .
many people di n't healthcare enough money pay treatment .
n't think america sending people solve problem 've fixed healthcare crisis .
, think problem kenya fixed .
another reason believe problem wo n't fixed soon author said malaria disease kill many people africa .
th solution bed net cheap medicine unaffordable may african .
would take many people work together create affordable healhtcare , give job pay higher wage .
n't seem realistic many nation would work together .
rival would ot become alleis war poverty .
n't believe many thse country would want work together , even good cause .
one last reason n't think chievable lifetime kenya n't impoverished country world .
possibley hundred ocuntries without proper resource .
n't believe lifetime lifetime enough time get rid extreme poverty issue world .
many place kenya , india , indonesia , nigeria , afganistan palces need seriosu help lifetime , matter hard try , enough .
however , hope closing good note , poverty ended .
best thing try .
would n't expect go india andimprove water condition yoruself .
however , could find local organizaiton sends financial aid third world country make effort support .
could donate place begin non profit organization .
author said would take 'the world work together change poverty-stricken area good ' .
even though may take awhile , n't mean nothing .
worked one village time giving food water money thing time village would item suplyes need exspeshaly childred work hard school
food keep energy maskitos kill hard dont food money get right treatment need think autheir good job exsplaining village need suplys .

hospital medicine , free charge , school serve lunch .
free net help prevent malaria , even people get infected witt , get free treatment .
farmer tool fertilizer , n't worry family going hungry .

think would likely easy task .
2008 already made progress like hospital medicine free cured common disease , plus water electricity .
also bed net every sleeping site sauri .

good thing put every bed net every sleeping site beause really little .

many country 50 state took four year kenya country recover .
50 time four two-hundred take really long .
second reason many people need help n't much time state country people living long gone .
little late .

proverty hard prevent happening every country country .
fifth reason hard right think might happen afterward .
proverty make thing hard people live example kenya earn $ 1 day ca n't find money themselve plus child .
five reason proverty might still going even turn 70 .
n't believe prediction 'm wrong believe world better place live ever .
author hasnl't convinced believe win fight poverty .
one reason child always saying n't want go school .
n't good education wo n't money pay tax .
tax money thing need inproved , ca n't .
thing good like school hospital start needing repair wo n't .
time someone get really old , wo n't time , energy , determinatin make change .
soon continues happen rich country turn country poverty .
maybe like kenya .

may also get hold head company , get much bed net could .
od would amazing .
've seen plenty assocations present time .
really put heart , mind , soul , time could make happen .
, question ask : going really enough ?
basically come back main question : win fight poverty ?
author taught work together team , achieve something thatn expect .
example , story say bed net everyone , enough water crop , lunch school fee , story say pay medicine lot medicine tell
everybody worked together make happen .
really think government thoughtful instead selfish , people kenya would better place year 2008 .

poverty severe , people experienced death .
another evidence support answer , well poverty world charity might get , poverty still earth charity help donating food , water , blanket , certain material .
poverty might never stop since country struggling money budget .

school serve lunch student .
second 20,000 kid die day disease .
main malaria , came mosquito .
achieved stop people getting malaria sealing bed net also free charge , common disease .
last least author convinced thing improve , even look impossible .
farmer worryed maybe even harvest enough food feed whole family .
crisis hunger addressed fertilizer seed .
beautiful breakthrough would feel lived poverty country ?
money , health care , feritlizer , medicine , school supply , clothes shoe ?
opinion feel author made great arguement , 2011 going economy .
2004 sauri made $ 1 day .
millennium village project helping people sauri get poverty , access health care , help stabilize economy , get feritilizer , get medicine school supply .
project people sauri n't much nothing .
hospital 3 child bed , 2 adult bed .
room filled patient could n't afford , hospital n't .
doctor clinical officer running hospital .
water electricity .
disease common africa malaria .
pest carry malaria mosquito .
something prevents mosquito bed net , chemical net cost $ 5 dollar , made $ 1 day .
almost 20,000 kid die malaria .
2008 organitzation helped sauri .
author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime woman , man , child suffering alot .
woman would sit dusty ugly looking ground selling banana .
feel really sad little kid suffer alot barefoot ripped ugly clothes n't get much education .
also feel happy people get help , plan get people poverty , assure health care , fix people way life community .
hopefully progress sauri show u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
yes , author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
convinced article said 2004 hospital running water , electricity , enough bed patient .
hospital n't enought treatment patient price also high , 4 year , hospital medicine common dieseases , water , electricity .
also , article said farmer worried good crop .
important sell crop money use crop feed family .
millewnium village ' project work family much better crop gave fertilizer tool keep crop going family sell eat .
another reason hannah ( author ) convinced article said kid could n't go school n't school supply , money school fee , parent needed kid chore help .
kid went school alway tired school n't get mid-day snack .
later , school fee , kid got lunch , attendance rate .
work building big sucess .
infer think get better everyone .
glad people voleenteered help africa , maybe one day help .
convinced winning fight poverty achivable .
one reason think might happen one problem solved appear .
desperate would need think fix thing important .
would think possibility .
would need solution .
another reason hospital , really important medical issue people n't enough money pay medical cost .
homeless people dont money pay home even die money issue .
medicine also important .
sometimes get sick need people dont enough money ca n't find medicine need .
money always requiered .
money , everybody need survive .
need food medicine much .
expirience going store buy food needing 10 cent could n't get .
like give homeless people money go get food eat .
money really big issue .
desieses really harmful many .
also many way get .
kill many people day .
greatful dessise 's still possible get one .
convinced winning fight possible .
author think important kid united state lean life like kenya millennium village project want world work togither change poverty-stricken area good .
think change people sauri 4 year every one help save village world .
life kenya millennium village project hard .
example n't enough bed hospital 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
another example ther doctor medicine patient .
last example didnt bed net keep mosquito carry malaria .
life kenya millennuim village project nice .
exsample hospital enough bed supply person .
another exsample hospital bed net keep mosquito carry malaria form coming beting people .
yes , winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
example yala-sub-district hospital medicine , water .
electricty .
food supply school get eat lunch .
school fee kid going school .
bed net mosquito carry disease .
donating toy , cothing , food could go back poor .
plus people around world donat stuff kenya .
winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
peronally feel .
's 6 billion people world .
done one village , done world .
many people living poverty , yet many people much 2004 .
whole group people traveled sauri made difference .
made remarkable change better .
people truly inspiring , want whole world live poverty 'd need people .
first , make world proverty-free , lot help .
millennium village project inspiring message goal .
people aknowledge message could get 1,000 people join .
project would take lot work , ca n't set deadline going accomplished .
work progessly together instead rushing .
$ 1 day , 112 million child ca n't proper education , 1 30 people die instead .
help people sold volunteer properly trained medical teaching .
ca n't find job , simply help village .
would mean getto live dream help many people time .
n't amazing ?
conclusion , yes , win fight poverty lifetime .
volunteering something simple basically anyone help .
ca n't really set deadline one predict 'll done everything achieveable work hardest .
opinion think could fight poverty give people need like medicine , food could money maybe donate
better job could also send ton fertilizer seed
could plant grow food thing build building modern like hospital could get alot experienced doctor help .
could send teacher weill teach adult teach kid .
mostly need money could buy medicine , education , house need , resource .
think thank reading .
think possible fight agianst poverty , might take cile story made big change .
first example stoory befor people helped lot sick people could pay medicine .
sauri people medicine free .
second exampl begining people lived sauri fertilizer , tool farm , seed crop hungry people helped tho thing .
third example mallenniun villege kid pay school could aford .
one could aford n't get lunch .
school fee free school provide lunch .
make change like food , medicine , seed grow crop fertalizer , tool , book much , think many place need soport .
'improving slowly ' let take sauri , kenya .
hospital clean sanitized ; everyone going school ; electricity bed net everywhere ; many medication taking care common disease region .
seems pretty similar community , right ?
, n't always way sauri , kenya .
'm writing essay show kenya looked mellenium development goal .
, 's sauri like .
first , millenium development goal could met 2015 , 2025 .
, still lot work .
hospital dirty .
three kid bed two adult bed , patient could n't treated either n't money , hospital n't supply help .
doctor , clinical officer running hospital , running water electricity .
sadly , people hospital small disease helped like malaria , common disease kenya caused mosquito bite .
room improvement .
another problem deal farming .
lot crop dying farmer could n't afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
, family plant seed good outcome loss fertilizer irrigation .
family plant enough seed feed .
, lot time farmer worrying whether able provide family .
another problem condition school .
many kid ca n't attend school parent could n't afford school fee .
others could n't attend school kid needed help chore , like fetching water wood .
school minimal supply , book , paper , pencil , , circumstance , wanted learn .
hard student concentrate lunch .
, time student got home , exhausted .
, sauri , kenya really last five year .
thing looked pretty impossible .
, poverty really bad thing region , close beating .
5 year 2015 , sauri gone long way .
prof anywhere everywhere poverty , beat .
yes n't like thinking someday going poor know going fauity rich .
know going poor .
think body femeos goiong vist countrieis one day help really need money .
example aeieu key went simillar help
like someone faumous probly lend money ton countrna
need kid
molsr carrying around deises
alot kid die cause ca n't affourd money
hysitall .
feel sad ceck information parger 2.4,5 6 , 7 .
parshp 8 say help childred .

millennium village project supposed help village africa escape poverty .
hannah sachs convince 'winning fight poverty ' achievable 4 year 80 village dramatically changed flourished .
sauri people lived le dollar day .
instance , hannah visited yala sub-district hospital , 'the room packed patient probably n't recieve treat , either hospital , patient could n't afford ' ( 1 ) .
money .
addition , 'malaria common disease africa preventable treatable .
kid die adult get sick .
' ( 1 ) .
'm going realist , poverty gone lifetime .
hannah convinced .
feel like always going poverty matter live .
first example introduction say people sauri lived le dollar day !
tell condition town , horrible .
1 $ day around 1/30 amount american use today .
thats enough healthy food clean water !
second example 20,000 kid die disease day .
later paragraph said 5 $ net could save million life , question , 20,000 kid die world africa ?
5 $ mosquito net prevent bite kid playing outside ?
last example winning fight poverty acheviable lifetime .
well , even u.s. still alot people poverty line .
supposed win even world greatest nation ca n't beat poverty ?
peccimist , impossible end poverty lifetime maybe forever .
yes , believe win fight agains proverty kenya , 3 main reason .
first , millennium village project giving better food medical supply .
secondly , progres fight aginst proverty spreading around kenya .
finally , eighty village already fixed , 's fixed .
first reason proverty end kenya millennium village project providing better food medical supply .
major factor influence sustainable surrival through-out area .
food provides energy people , cna live mediicnes protect people sickenesses disease .
main reason sfor death kenya based ont articla lack food medication .
supply , kenyan people survive live better .
secondly , progres sof fight proverty moving around kenya .
supply sand support help people live bieng brought different area .
main support help free food , medicine education .
prevent local people spending moeny .
since spending money , saving , larger amound money prevending proverty .
process spreading across kenya helping many people , eventually , goal end proverty complete .
( 4rd pharagraph next page ) last reason 80 village kenya allready fixed free proverty .
prof even village may fixed .
using procedure millennium village project used fix first 80 village , use fix rest kenya .
also , proverty free villiages set example organization help join solve problem .
three reason believe proverty eliminated world goal met .
yes author convince 'winning fight poverty achivable lifetime ' .
example started 2004 four year 2008 better school supply bed net everyone .
n't need pay school go hospilal .
hospilal also got water electricity medicine manny common deseases .
think 2015 poverty kenya wont problem anymore .
yes last sentence title better life- 2008 say sauri 's progress show u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
another example kid age , want kind poverty thing history .

best explain .
author convince winning fight poverty achievable life .
agree would'nt easy possible achievable goal work really hard put good effort work .
like people helped millennium village sauri , first got , horrible , people bad clothing , people really sick disease like malaria lack food .
farmer could grow crop could n't afford pay fertilizer irrigation , year farmer worry ton thing .
hannah sachs walked yala sub-district hospital , good shape .
aleast three people sharing bed hospital .
room packed patient probably would receive treatment , either hospital patient could afford .
many kid attend school parent could afford school fee , 2004 , school minimal supply like book , paper pencil , student want learn .
worked hard supply , hard student concentrate work .
midday meal .
people sauri many amazing progress 4 year .
yala-sub-district hospital medical free charge , common disease .
water connected hospital , also generator electricty .
bed net used every site sauri .
hunger crisis addressed fertilizer seed well tool needed maintain food supply .
school fee lunch school student .
agree author 'winning fight proverty achievable lifetime ' help united nation donating something help millennium village project .
example yala sub-district hospital bad shape .
electricity water .
doctor , clinical officer .
could help united nation donating dollar yala sub-district hospital could afford treatment patient , running water electricity .
maybe even doctor .
donating five dollar help prevent disease malaria people proverty afford bed net .
another example farming education .
farmer crop dying lack fertilizer water .
keep donating helping could help farmer afford fertilizer , interigation water could harvest enough crop get money family eat .
article say 'most kid sauri attend school parent could afford school fee ' 'in 2004 , school minimal supply like book , paper , pencil , student wanted learn ' .
worked hard supply .
donate money kid could get education supply school .
donating money united nation could help better sauri people .

4 year millennium village project done hospital enough medicine everyone also free
patient sick n't worry thing .
also malaria huge problem people .
mosquito go house everyone asleep bite get malaria .
easy way stop 20,000 child die day .
something called bed net keep mosquito away chemical cost $ 5 people usually use $ 1 per day food .
millennium village project done every house/sleep site bed net protect mosquito sauri .
also farmer 's crop dying lack water proper fertilizer .
every time farmer plant seed , outcome always poor crop .
2008 crop good shape water , perfect fertilizer even proper tool maintain food supply .
2004 school n't enough material book , paper pencil le child school

'making change ' think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity 'fund raiser ' kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back 's foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenya 's poverty , think 's unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money n't want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country n't poorest country .
're alot better everything .

yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wo n't die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
yes anything could happen keep trying achive goal .
anyone could try hard enough .
author convinced winning fight poverty acheivable outline even poverty many place , still acheivable many way .
first example sauri , kenya africa .
started nothing millennium village project gave thing first food , good shelter fertilizer clothing .
started get supply needed .
next example also many place africa clean water get sick .
slowly , organization bringing clean water african village .
also believe hard win fight poverty .
reason think , poverty exists around world different case .
hard end , still possible .
believe winning fight poverty possible .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
article convinced helping people poverty good thing .
text said 20,000 kid die desease day .
sad seeing kid age even younger die day .
also farmer cant grow crop water fertilizer .

millenium village project could afford medicine school free also school provides lunch .
true ?
believe reading article convinced fight poverty achievable lifetime sub-saharan africa .
came conclusion hannah sachs gave multiple great example work achieved four year 2004-2008 .
example sachs state hospital called yala sub-district hospital already initiated program medicine .
best part medicine free charge .
another thing seems promising bed net already used sleeping location sauri .
good sleeping/bed net le desises .
result hospital le ocupied wich alow patient problem actually attended .
another critical thing hunger crisis handled .
fertilizer passed vegtebles fruit grow stronger .
also seed distributed impovreshed comunities get food .
crop start go well alow kid go school , free charge .
also allow kid school bring lunch wo n't lost energy middle day , causing discouraged , distracted , school work class .
due reason think resolved poverty crisis im generation .
fact thing 4 year mean definitly resolve poverty crisis least sub-saharan africa may place hopefully .
yes author convince winning fight poverty achievable liftime , also know sometimes take four year .

room full patient probably couldnt afford getting help .
doctor supervisor running building , .
people also could n't fix crop child adult dying disease called malaria .

family dying fertilization crop .
plus people needed irrigation crop .
finally mellenium village project came kenya .
hospital medicine free charge .
water connected hospital .
generator also installed electricity .

intro first reason important to/for kid know kenya when/as get older helpout kenya lot material & resource n't .
another reason important to/for kid know kenya
time/at present time maybe look back history & see poor food/no $ maybe learn lesson

another thing patient went hospital , doctor , water/electricity , top child & adult share bed .
( 2-3 kid one bed , & $ one drame .
also 2004 disease called malaria , disease person betten mosquito .
good thing preventable , people bed net cover bed insect could get many people one .
country terrible .
2008 2008 4 year later /sauri /had changed year , people n't pay school fee farmer fertilizer & seed grow crop , generator hospital used to/for electricity .

serf lunch , much people go school .
school hospital free charge , powered money given millenium village help people poverty .

improve four year likely improve another 17 year .
people sauri provided fertilizer seed , helped elimitnate problem hunger .
hospital medicine provided n't worry able pay medicine .

malaria , happens mosqoitoes carry , people bed net get
one get ,
cost 5 $ .
ca n't buy one get le $ 1 dollar day , trying make better community assore .
heath care help stabilize economy quality life community .
leaning towards yes , make enormous impact small village 's reason could n't type change another small village maybe work thier way city .
doubt might enough money make bigger impact several village , town , city , etc .
one reason considering doubting image thier working common many people .ways world [ illegible ] , make self known public different country least gather sponsers .
onse gather attention , donation , sponsers almost 100 % likely succeding making change would worked hard .

1 example gave u 80 village across sub-saharan africa dramaticly changed .
second example gave u made amazing progress fretilizaing crop letting grow .
final example food child adult provided water medicane hospitle .
think author right quate .
winning fight agaisnt poverty achievable ?
think achievable difficult .
winning fight agaisnt poverty achievable actually affecting helping better .
fight better health getting better example ) sachs stated yala sub-distric hospital medicine , free charge , allthe common disease ( 2 ) .
sachs pointing made hospital lot better mean going le people dying disease .
fertilizer water crop .
example , sachs asserts hunger crisis addressed fertilizer seed , well toold needed maintain food supply ( 2 ) .
sachs stating good source food right .
mean le crop dying enough food people .
change made 4 year .
thing better 2004 2008 .
instance , sachs asserts dramatic change occured 80 village across sub-saharan africa .
( 2 ) .
sachs pointing made major change four year .
good amount food supply medicine .
made survivibility africa .
showed progress four year made possible fight agaisnt poverty , health , food .
mean hard achievable fight agaisnt poverty .
think winning fight poverty achievable four year , manage supply hospital medicine treat common disease , connect water hospital , generate electricity .
also managed put bed net every sleeping site , keep mosquito away , adress fertilizer , seed , tool maintain food supply , make school free charge plus free lunch .
dramatic change occured 80 different village across sub-saharan african .
think could improve much four year , could possibly win fight poverty one life time .
hannah sachs convinced winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
text state water dirty 2004 .
2008 changed water clean .
hannah sachs convinced help poor text state 2004 pay school running low supply .

2008 electricity , ment light light sun .
2004 getting sick dieing mosquito carring malaria .

2008 bought net $ 5 .
net would protect people mosquito .
fight poverty achievable many people kenya working hard stop poverty .
project started 2004 deadline 2015 's 8 year way people working help 's enough time .
millennium project want help hospital cure disease like malaria giving mosquito bitting people .
since family life $ 1 day net protect people mosquito cost $ 5 many family ca n't afford .
helping family stay heathly another goal people instead buying net buy food help family survive .
2008 project done lot progress think time left lot help kenya .
think author convinced winning fight poverty achievable lifetime group people think helping , nomore poor people world .
example , like many disease africa witch treated easily .

importantly school supply like pencil , eraser , book , many supply provide poor people .
please help poor people .

' .
well first think important might encourage alot kid help kenya get better .
farmer subsistence farming crop still wo n't grow well , could use help get even come kid .
second learning struggle kenya millenium village project could make kid like thankful take granted .
like kenya get sick there slight chance 'll able pay even live severly sick .
united state there alot medicine answer problem .
change made kenya thanks millenium villiges project .
well conclusion kenya 's struggle like said dramatic change happened like water hospital medicine aswell .
im trying say kenya 's time , help gotten good time .
winning fight poverty achievable within lifetime ?
think .
?
give supply one village , another , another , one village run supply .
course , n't know full story , justify .
reason : sauri one village .
hundred village need supply .
time 90 year , sauri need maintenence , village .
go endless loop .
supply enough resource village ?
difficult thing , might achievable .
take million dollar .
example every village kenya 100 people , one hospital , seed , maintenance fee , add $ 6000 per village .
200,000 village , million , kenya .
price would total $ 6,000,000,000 !
six billion dollar .
someone pay , would plausable .
someone contribute much , impossible .
winning fight zero poverty maybe-maybe situation .
people donate six billion dollar .
need constantly supply village seed , water , fertilizer , maintain hospital .
n't think zero-poverty possible .
near future least .

132501y2_ 100264524 yes , need take caure health , ca n't , poverty .
also , child need egucation , ca n't get stay home chore .
something else ca n't afford take care .
world make diffrence , take time .
another thing think achieve goal take time .
example 2008 got bed net , water , electricity hospital .
take time .
think author convince 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' win fight people kenya , africa would struggle life food , water , electricity .
think kid would better advantage go school get education need .
also people would get medication treatment need .
example : three kid bed two adult bed , room packed patient probably would recieve treatment , either hospital n't could n't afford .
crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
fight , sauri would great fertilizer grow crop food food eat .
many kid could n't get education parent could afford school fee .
school minimal amount supply like book , paper , pencil kid .
sauri , africa improved 2004-2008 getting water connected hospital , also generator electricity .
bed net used often .
hunger solved seed tool used garden maintain food supply .
think would day africa life change .
better tool africa .
also day lower school fee , kid could go school , everyone much better life !
yes possible example , send money , send school supply , send sans food , help get medisen .
belive futur 2015 2025 rich life sick many people kid dieing .
arthor convinced telling horrible thing village faced .
example 20,000 kid dieing misqotoses , water , generator light place , people dieing n't .
sound like people n't life even worse , water keep people thurstyness farmer grow crop food feed family .
wounder really survive .
author n't convinced win fight poverty within life time .
poverty huge massive thing pain suffering cover world .
people short supply medecine hey need .
money spend day $ 1 .
's another thing .
mony donate make difference , yes , happen people stop giving money ?
poverty big mass pain fear , somebody starving .
poverty hard stop .
way , ca n't stop poverty soon stop one area 's poverty , somebody else go hungry .
hannah said , dramatic change occured 80 village accross sub-saharan africa .
80 village lot people .
think , 80 village helped , many helped ?
billons people world .
small fraction rich .
recession , middle class began fall apart based people n't job could n't pay money tax .
else would people like barack o'bama mitt romney foucusing middle class .
pretty soon , world made rich people poor people .
poverty pretty hard stop , like hannah say , matter , someone go hungry .
day 20,000 kid die disease day , kid sick fill place missing one .
every time person get brought hospital 's medicine , die quickly .
sometimes people simply ca n't afford medicine .
death .
since condition improved , world , people dying disease n't suffer anymore .
many died poverty ?
win war something big ?
people impoverished village like one hannah went $ 1 day spend bare necesities life .
pour thousand dollar project , even money , still million people world hungry .
much money world .
people generouse throw poverty trying help others .
every village help , someone go hungry .
year , people become reliant benefactor , well , soon one place running , move money someplace else .
sometimes area rich support slip back poverty .
poverty world .
stop impossible nature money .
long value world , always someone le .
, cure world ?
answer ca n't , improve , even challenging task .
yes , believe winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
think first hospital sauri run-down , without water , electricity , proper medicine .
hospital medication , family likely could pay .
people treated afford medication .
running water electricity health problem surely minimized .
another topic help fight poverty u farming .
much fertilizer proper irrigation .
farmer also worried feeding family , child would die firm starvation .
millennium village project family fertilizer , seed , proper irrigation .
product hunger sauri reduced , well death .
finally , better school benefit .
first , due lack supply , food , money many child n't get education .
without money could n't pay supply food .
also , without lunch child would lose energy able concentrate work .
money , supply , food student successful day .
conclusion , believe win fight poverty .
sauri better crop , hospital education area sauri better ever .
sauri well maybe help area need .
believe something back return .
maybe dream far enough whole world saved .

estes_020012496 n't think 'winning fight poverty ' possible lifetime even help people around u .
everywhere around u , people poor afford healthcare , food , and/or education .
need little boost willing help .
article , hannah sachs mentioned change made sauri , kenya four year ' time .
make change happen worldwide , would need lot people willing donate money obviously wo n't come impoverised country .
take four year stabilize one village sauri , imagine long would take stabilized rest kenya .
think ' winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' talking fighting one two country win fight worldwide would take generation people willing fight cause .
every generation , people would required million dollar fund supply poverty-stricken area world need survive physically economically .
would also need people teach country 's leader spend large ( small ) amount money 're given .
matter look , problem come money fund people willing help .
unlikely chance winning fight poverty 'd say impossible win especially lifetime .
think poverty eliminated generation 's lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri n't simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u n't avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people could n't afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri n't go school .
found n't enough thing book pencil .
majority student n't eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
yes think winning fight againts poverty achivible 2004 villiage sauri , kenya realy poor 2008 running water hospital generator gave electricity bed net used every slapping sit .
also kid go school withe payin school fee give lunch material nd like 2004 barley supply .
farmer fertelizer plant food crop dont die .
winning fight poverty achievable life ?

yes future people world awarness village kenya help give money food , people kenya disease infection n't die get really sick .
already 's getting better hospital medicine , 's getting better hospital medicine , free charge , common disease yala sub-district hospital .
also text say room packed patient probably would recieve treatment , either
hospital patient could afford
people could change people money sick people rich healthy horse .
also people big support maybe reach goal getting people poverty year 2013 .
could get child adult overfilled stomach nothing inside .
paragraph water , fertilizer , knowledge say many kid sauri attend school parent could afford school fee .
kid could n't education knowledge parent le dollar day , really think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
real main idea achieve fight poverty .
article millennium development goal making difference poverty sauri .
reading , convinced believe chance win poverty lifetime .
article give strong example change already made far .
sauri started poor place .
example , article state , time , people sauri lived le $ 1 day ( 1 ) .
fact alone , obvious needed big change .
live le dollar , also hospital packed sick child adult ony clinical officer aid .
also electricity running water .
sight unbearable author 's eye .
majority sick people also preventable disease like malaria could 've prevented $ 5 bed net .
simple task yet everyone could 've afforded .
addition hospital , author also state , many kid sauri attend school parent could afford fee ( 2 ) .
handful student attend school struggle book , paper , pencil .
always energy within end day .
last thing author talked farmer .
farmer always worry could feed family fertilizer irragation grow crop .
big problem ebcause would cause many people die starvation .
even problem , millennium village project people worked hard solve .
first , started letting electricity circulate throughout hospital provide medcine free charge .
big change prevent many people dying .
article also state , school fee , school serf lunch student ( 1 ) .
action caused many student attend school .

people dieing , without water food also medication ,
basicaly
believe 'winning fight poverty ' achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine n't high people able donate reasonal amount money help people 's life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wo n't grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , would n't live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri n't hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also n't midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
n't get privilages , believe change .
134501y2_ 000496130 instead donating 1 dollar person would donate 20
remember homeless people used come mom 's car window would close fare said protect u
said give love
eat instead live homeless ask change give like five dollar food instead might
small thing .
bed net save million people life thats good look better thing future dont pas away poverty might look forward child .

many people go school lost life one reason could make life better .

everyone could go school .
another reason could help others .
like hospital , could buy bed kid adult .
electricity water connect hospital .
people money buy bed net , people would n't disease let mosquito bit people .
thing people need would n't cost lot people ca n't buy .
reason people could earn money buy stuff .
stuff needed .
could earn money go school go hospital .
go school learn .
money buy seed something else .
person wrote show fight againt proverty could happen even sooner .
think fight proverty could completed die right .
think achevable lifetime 2008 said electricity , water , school , bed net , tool maintain food supply .
2004 dieying 20,000 kid diying day .
since made progress 4 year , like 80 year , imagine would like girl kept trying .

yes , achavement auother still help people argument helping people ca n't acheve still even thoght half need 's articel convinsing .
one exsample artcel .
befor year 2008 people kenya still working hard find get splies need enogh food survie .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think winning fight poverty achievable help get food , fertilizer , & supply .
fertilizer africa crucial .
every gave fertilizer , would make life better ; fertilizer , make soil ritcher thing much healthier , like crop .
food important .
need neutrients live .
also 'd need fertilizer .
grow food , african 's eat healthy .
food made , would make people africa 's life better start eat lunch school get home .
speaking school , gave supply school , kid would better education .
would easier develope thing pencil & paper actually .
learn , like miny step brighter future .
would really want african citizen know feel instead crappy life .
yes agree hannah sachs battle proverty achievable lifetime m.v.p helped sauri kenya needed hospital bed , doctor , clean water , electricity , medicine , help proverty .
problem hospital bed three kid aloud one bed two adult one bed .
one room would packed sick people .
article state solution proplem .
problem doctor clinical officer running hospital .
n't proffesionals treat patient correctly .
way m.v.p help hospital medicine disease discovered .
also found cure common disease .
disease malaria .
malaria carried mosquito come night .
protection disease bed net .
problem clean water dirty water could infect open cut water could carry disease .
m.v.p soon connected clean water well building using underground pipe .
problem electricity clinical officer volunteer working patient night time would light see .
m.v.p put generator hospital .
another problem forgot mention food .
m.v.p farmer fertilizer well clean water .
grow crop without dying .
based article believe author convince believe winning fight poverty achievable lifetime three key example .
1 example clearly state people sauri made unbelievable progress four year .
1 thing support example yala sub-district hospital medicine , free charge , common dieseases .
another example water connected throughout hospital also genorator electricity .
also hunger crisis addressed fertilizer seed well tool also needed maintain stable food supply .
also school fee , school serving lunch student .

jump 'people could n't pay bed net , ' 'now enough bed net person .
' exactly happened ?
said could n't pay bed net , manage get end ?
buy people sauri , kenya , make give ?
think talked enough .
story need information .
said crop could n't grow , make money later ?
yes convinced possible 5 # dollar prevent someone dying muisquitos , net stop .
also cheap medicine stop disease catch .
another reason four year conncted running water hospital .
also n't charge people common disease .
another reason convinced living poverty needed help .
mentioned laidie floor selling banans .
also kid wering torn ragged cloth waking bare foot one made say yes woulde n't grow food soil bad enough water .

expensive .
kyle_089981044 problem africa occurring .
problem like lack medical knowledge , farming supply , education .
luckily , < illennium village project working solve problem .
author given many example going sauri , kenya .
convinced 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
' believe many reason .
first , problem already taken care 4 year , 2004 2008 .
farmer n't tool .
bed net provided prevent malaria .
child also able go school , free charge .
second , believe remaining problem serious , time think effective thing .
believe much confronted 4 year , remaining 7 year used achieve great thing .
, united nation likely achieve aimed .
many problem already solved .
2015 , may many serious problem africa , , author said , 'it easy task .
'
think united state kid learn kenya show dont compane school back 2004 school kenya n't lunch .
life kenya millennium village project sad , really poor , little food .
life kenya happy , food school , money .
several reason , think winning fight poverty achieveable lifetime .
first reason thinking way much millenium village project improved medical funding sauri , kenya .
back 2004 , sauri could barely hold hospital .
hospital water electricity .
two logical utility public health center need .
inside , 3 child 2 adult would share bed .
hospital would packed people , could probably enough medicine help sick dying people .
second reason believing win poverty much food farming improved .
many farmer could get good crop .
1 ) n't good tool .
fertilizer could help solve problem .
fertilizer help increase quantity quality crop , could help problem enough food family .
2 ) n't enough water .
plant need two thing flourish , sunlight water .
, big change made , farmer good supply water , fertilizer , seed , tool .
next reason present school fund improved .
2004 , went classroom , would see many child .
child could afford needed home .
school would often many supply .
millenium village project , school fee school better supply .
also serve lunch , something many school offer .
last final reason help millenium village spread several place .
many village sub-saharan africa changed drastically .
many people live poverty , attend school , enough food water family , medicine .
conclusion , think win fight .
seeing change make think way .
quality life improve millenium village project sauri kenya based artical author convince winning fight proverty achiveable lifetime ?
many solution problem keep people impoverished take world work together change proverty stricken area good kid age want kind poverty thing history
easy task
sauri progress show u winning fight poverty achievable life time

people n't die often .
thats winning fight agaist poverty achievable lifetime .

people sauri got supply needed food .
free hospital electricity , water , & medicine .
millennium prodect could world 's neediest place .

reason food plant come good fresh .
infer tack lot people win battle .
little kid close wear kid go school much thing use .
people need fertilizer planting grow good .
people sick hospital help
believe possible world free poverty .
think society provided simple thing like medicine , electricity , water economy continue evolve .
example amount growth happened sauri 2008 huge 4 year think 'll get even better kid able go school .
another way economy grow poverty enough food .
sauri tool needed food guaranteed instead family starving poor harvest .
lastly believe overcome poverty others helping .
whole reason sauri gotten poverty millenium project helping little providing necessary tool daily life .
hospital medicine free charge common disease water connected hospital also 9 generator electricity .
3 2008 made lot progress sauri easier take care child feed .
dramatic change occurred 80 village across sub saharan africa .

first reason le 3 year fix problem .
second , people might know millennium village project .
third , big chance men woman wo n't donate .
poverty 2015 little 2 year fix problem .
even billion billion dollar , would n't able reach every impovershed village , every starving child , every needy person .
think 've made incredible progress , sill much .
get rid poverty , would need stretch deadline lea 10 year .
's think 3 year n't enough time .
many people n't know millennium village project .
never even heard today !
fact , im pretty sure class never heard today , lot people watch news , look online news , read newspaper , people n't really watch story !
also , lot people touch reality n't pay attention news .

might greedy .
others might enough money donate .
, like said previous paragraph , might know project .
people day lot thing mind .
might forget give money .
people end donating .
might give enough money help .
conclusion , think wo n't tread poverty 2015 n't enough time enough people knowing & donating millennium village project .
maybe someday poverty !
wo n't long time , maybe even lifetime .
think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime

also , article say , many solution problem keep people impoverished .
may hard stressful , achieveable !
think could achieve property 1 .
try hardest 2 .
brave n't scared 3 .
lazy .
know true number 2 .
article said school student try hardest , thought would make sense student wanted try win property smart brain .
2nd answer adult child brave enough sleep without bed sheet , even could n't afford still brave enouhg live without bed sheet .
3rd answer text said child would n't go school parent ca n't affording school feed child/children would chore , tht gave idea lazy .
yes , possible help kenya , importantly , rest world 's drowned sea poverty , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
's achievable hannah pointed problem found sauri , changed 4 year .
read find progress simply amazing , n't hard .
realize every impoverished area world fixed , would great life .
second example dramatic change occured 80 village across sub-saharan africa , progress encourage supporter millennium village project .
think 's great , long encourage supporter millennium village project , 's millennium village project .
u together help make poverty thing past .
third example yala sub-district hospital able save many life , equal many lived poverty .
's good .
lot u want life ability live .
everybody right live , life n't taken away whoever poverty .
fourth final example school n't lot supply beginning , midday meal , kid n't well school .

, work together , poverty completely eliminated .
yes , fight proverty achievable lifetime , , quote text , 'the people sauri made amazing progress four year ' .
four year , people sauri managed better life , crop better , fee school , hospital medicine .
may take longer due amount village africa , achievable human life span work hard enough .
four year , poverty-stricken village , kid pretty much dm reach 3th grade , actually acceleraded growth point develpping city mach like city world .
quote text , 'the yala sub-district hospital mendicine , free chage , common disease , ' goulse mark sucess growth , due hospital medience treat expensive .
quote , 'dramatic change occurred 80 village across sub-saharan africa , ' change occurred 4 year .
would easy win fight proverty .
winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
well , know 1.2 billion people live le one dollar day ?
115 million child n't school ?
two side people belive done thoose say : way !
issue important affect billion people .
personally , think ca n't done .
first reason opinion helped 80 village 4 year .
million village need help .
, math right , would take 5,000 year help 1,000,000 village !
also , would need money volunteer ( see next paragraph ) .
counter argument reason would something like : everybody support , could reach goal .
well , rebuttal would state everybody would support .
second reason revolves around fact would cost trillion help everyone .
first , would need electricity everybody .
second , would need water .
third , 'd need school supply school .
next , would supply medicine hospital , much much .
one classmate say everybody contributes one dollar , might enough .
counter counter argument would say everybody would contribute ( poor people , people intrested , etc .
) 7 billion enough .
last reason nobody know .
fix need handful volunteer , money advertising ( sign billboard , commertials , ad , etc .
) big amount time get everything organized .
counter argument would : people volunteer , others donate advertisement , rest try contribute somehow .
, people wo n't volunteer would need hire worker , replied .
people may say every body support could reach goal .
disagree statement need advertising , need money , need volunteer .
restate opinion , say nobody know , would cost trillion help everybody world would need time .
improve situation could extend deadline 1,000 year , everyone world donate lea 10 dollar .
many resons u kid know .
mine kid know lucky go school every day .
kid africa dont even get chance go school .
africa right project came .
really bad hospital .
running water electricity .
enough bed , 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
also doctor .
clinical office .
people would recive tretment ca n't afford n't .
big problem malira .
des parasite inters human bit mosketo child die , adult get sick .
1 way mairial mosketos bit bed net .
$ 5 .
ca n't afford .
water electricity medicine .
still dont doctor .
farmer ment .
farmer alot thing worry .
worry crop nicicry irrigation water .
irrigation way bring water dry land .
crop would die .
worry leed family .
also needed fertilizer replenish soil .
project came biuild irrigation .
also gave fertilizer seed .
see wanted u know help .
yes , author convince winning fight proverty achievable life time .
convinced could win fight proverty , started 2004 2008 thing already getting better .
goal supposed met 2015 ; others target set 2025 .
think goal met 2015 , thing got better four year , thing could get even better six year .
2025 lot time/years .
think family get least 1 2 net free .
think fear get paid alot , waste net .
need thing .
time people sauri lived le $ 1 dollar day .
net cost $ 5 .
work week get net .
kid adult would alread problaby died suverer .
dramatic change occured 80 village across sub-saharan africa .
90 village changed four year .
2015 six year away , 80 village could get changed .
would two year remaining , 80 village got changed four , two year 40 village could get fix .
time village need fixing could get fixed/changed .
another reason convinced .
say said easy task , everyones help effect could win fight poverty lifetime .
think convince u 'winning fight agian poverty achiavable lifetime ' girl tell sauri afica poor .
saw hospital kid share room bed aldats .
hospital water , etc , medasen .
almost every des .
saw kid school good .
parients could book .
kid would work hard hard work .
kid consactant could eat .
school money .
kid get home work .
farmer crop dyeing .
farmer afford necessy fertilizer help chore , fetching .
worry kid dyeing .
girl came back much better .
hospital right medasen .
hospital etc water .
kid school suppies like note book pensies .
mean .
convine .
yes halp kid go school get free school luns .
thik got school clas ta teire .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
's mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri n't even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply n't money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet 's affecting people n't five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food 's impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed crop ' growth farmer also n't extra money .
winning poverty n't impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime n't enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
based article author give convincing information winning fight poverty achievable lifetime paragraph three state goal poverty met 2015 goal met 2025 .
author also gave good information paragraph nine state people sauri made amazing progress four year example hospital running water , medicine free charge common disease .

author 'a brighter future ' convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say progress already made .
promise plan paragraph 3 'a brighter future ' .
example get people poverty , assure health care , help stabilize economy quality life today give practical item , technical advice .
2004 , farming education system bad .
paragraph 2 , heading 'water , fertilizer , knowledge quote 'schools minimal school supply like book , paper pencil ' also say high school fee lunch school .

farmer may need .
'the fight better health ' say .
lot people small bed , alot doctor .
people could afford $ 5 bed net .
4 year .
bed net every sleeping site .
also electricity .
short time happen , imagine happen lifetime .
paragraph 1 'water , fertilizer , knowledge say 'each year , farmer worry : harvest enough food feed family ?
're kid get sick hungry ?
well 2004 - 2008 .
un given farmer fertilizer seed tool needed perserve crop .
4 year sauri made least half promise even , deadine 4 year ago away .
think lifetime sauri , kenya fight poverty .
'help coming ' author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference today 's society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor ca n't afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid n't really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid n't much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
, n't think win fight proverty 'll take long .
also poor there money left .
plus , ca n't end proverty every wo n't live long enough .
proverty go forever .
's point trying end .
another example 's hot africa .
going run water food .
'll starving .
, 's point helping .
lastly , mch gold , rich .
africa money .
faking .
plenty money .
taking money america .
believe poverty ever completely eradicated world , much le life time , believe hard work , support , program like millennium village project , dramatically improve life living condition
underprivelaged impoverished .
progress millenium project clearly illustrates much achieve unite interest helping poor improving life .
effort , generosity , dedication , work set world path economic social equality .
one example dramatic astonishing improvement made millennium project upgrade yala sub-district sauri , kenya .
, 2004 , old , broken-down , equipped , understaffed establishment , hospital become , 2008 help millenium project , free , well-equipped , well-supplied center healing .
one example accomplishment fight poverty show much positive transformative difference make life impoverished underprivelaged .
instance show quality life improved sub-saharan africa upgrade farming ( donation seed fertilizer ) , improved school system school attendance , introduction bed net ( protect people malaria/mosquitos )
sleeping place sauri .
yet way life poor changing better show triumphing poverty .
major change 80 village sub-saharan region africa , millennium project proved template banishing poverty modern world .
poverty never completely leave world collective conscience , proved mercy poverty ; fight work help poor needy .
perhaps never reach goal , work toward dedication tenacity .
know bad thing happend kenya.life kenya medicine , docters lunch.after project got lunch medicine better life .
yes author convince 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' example patient probably would receive treatment , either hospital patient could afford .
also made sad .
mosquito carry malaria infect people biting .
kid die easily adult get sick .
crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
people samuri amazing progress four year .
yala sub-district hospital medicine free charge common disease .
water connected hospital , also generator electricity .
think yes , getting better better 2008 .
hospital medicine , water electricity connected hospital .
school fee , free lunch .
believe millennium village project get better better future .
yes , hannah sachs ( author ) say fight already started 2004 .
also , predicts may win fight 2015-2025 .
next , people sauri water connected hospital , fertilizer seed given , school fee , school serve lunch .
finally , sauri 's progress show u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
food kenya food kenya popple diding food kenya .
scribe food kenya .
people dying food kenya .
yes winning poverty achievable .
talking hosipal .
achievable america helping .
hospital give food , water , supples .
america gave money go school get better .
think overcome amount people involved poverty .
want overcome poverty take complete challenge overcoming poverty .
achieveable thing day .
also achieve goal many people supporting challenge .
example overcome poverty machineniry advance technology help crisis poverty .
one example four year got water electricity medicine hospital think year .
also think many people helping u come crisis poverty .
conclusion lot help crisis .
help add even small favor help lot .
probaly done problem within next year .
thin mosquito net help save lot people dieing malaria .
believe poverty ended reason : kid getting education , hospital medicine , bed net .
important young people get good education need get older know .
also important school enough material kid would n't write feather crazy thing .
think school also lunch break supply lunch .
another reason hospital must medicine sick people .
also must enough doctor nures .
hospital also need water electricity .
otherwise people wo n't able see drink hospital .
africa must lot mosquito .
mean bug could carry malaria .
common diease africa .
people need bed net cost $ 5 .
bed net used sleepping place .
solutation could save 20,000 kid life .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food n't buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people n't enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people ca n't afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wo n't share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .
claim poverty sauri lifetime might bit unbelevable , essay made think could possible .
many change need met seem doable .
instance , mosquito net could reduce molaria victim cost $ 5 , tiny amount money .
essay also convinced much change occurred four year .
article showed change , like hospital 's new medicine farmer getting irrigation fertilizer .
family poor , tends stay poor ca n't send child school better life .
convinced millenium project create drastic change break 'cycle poverty .
' investing education inject money previously poor family .
's possible stop proverty keep trying n't try stop proverty ca n't stop proverty .
donate money could get better school 's suppolies medicine hospital .
people could afford bed net keep getting sick .
would get water fertilizer many family wo n't starve .
would help child afford education learn happening .
teacher get paid would teach .
child grows , could start making money making donation stop proverty .
could get better skilled doctor help u hospoital .
treat patient help fasting doctor .
people afford money medicine wo n't die .
help stop proverty helping many people n't stop proverty , proverty stop u make life miserable .
think goal millennium village sauri , kenya suceede people like hannah around world help people millannium village sauri , kenya .
people around world help donating school supply , seed , fertilizer , money .
could help decorate hospital even help people hospital sick .
could also help people farmer help grow better crop could grow much faster .
another thing could could helppeople ca n't afford medicine .
yes want imporved project .
feel want imporved sauri , kenya see see .
millenniun village good place want deleompent goal .
want deleompent , capable meeding thing goal .
watns glimpse sauri showed u plenty work .
author , hannah sachs , us 'compare contrast ' 2 different time period support 'winning fight proverty achievable lifetime ' .
many reason support idea : change farming , supply school hospital .
change farming really important .
example , start project , crop dying farmer afford fertilizer irrigation .
cause enough food feed whole family .
therefore many child died hunger .
year 2008 , fertilizar water replaced hunger , tool maintain food supply .
thing change help start build wealth .
increase supply school hospital help keep people dying help poor people knowledge .
year 2004 , author stated even people afford go school aways run energy absent day lack food energy .
common diease treatable call malaria killed least 20,000 kid per day .
bed net is/can keep mosqutos malaria away cost $ 5 .
people sauri average $ 1 per day afford .
cause people dying disease preventable .
mid-way program , hospital/school fee , bed net used every sleeping site .
4 year .
village sauri dramatic change change future .
people poor starting built wealth maintance food supply , knowledge , health .
examples/evidence support 'winning fight proverty achievable life time ' .
many thing poverty people .
many reason poverty poeple .
example , people sauri affected poverty issue school , hospital .
later reason winning fight poverty acheivable .
first explanation people sauri need help healthcare stabilize economy , quality community .
reason village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine , school suplies dont get enough .
anotehr explanation hospital called yala sub-district hospital many hospital bed either 3 child 2 adult .
hospital run clinical officer doctor building .
running water electricity ; however , used water nearby river lake .
think winning fight poverty acheivable .
could send material u.s. china japan help .
researcher could bring supply sauri africa help whole sub-continent africa .
could also bring doctor teacher u africa hire school hospital .
poverty hurting people suffering people africa .
think win fight poverty power , power help .
sum poverty hurt people 20,000 people die due poverty .
help win 2015 2025 due plan .
article convince .
supported idea , gave information opinion place .
said 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' hannah made believe everything possible try .
believe information lead success 40 year .
's make sauri better place .
even though take time make improved young age braveness making better .
hannah think hospital way give supply family sauri .
hospital sauri charge water giving medicine sick people ( malaria attack ) would really help .
also fertilizer family .
last least free school fee serve free lunch kid .
hannah 's idea persuade .
idea persuading .
even though small thing help lot poverish people sauri , kenya .
hannah showed idea .
80 village across sub-saharan africa change kind matter made believe , idea spread across sauri .
hannah 's shoe would like idea bet thousand people sauri would support idea .
's 'everything possible'if try ' .
kind made argument rough data stuff going change .
right though sauri , kenya better community year ago .
sachs n't like way sauri looked like + community dealing w/ .
since millennium village project 8 year community poverty well ran city .
've problem like hannah & dad go dc usally go mall see people street sleeping garbage bag + sleeping bag .

school 's sound easy
either send teacher train people sauri teach ,
child learn better , & people donating suct program probably provide supply , paper .50 50 pack , hospital 's would harder becaues doctor harder find & train , medical supply
pricy .
running water & electricity ?
would need resource & engineres go kenys .
another hard part would making & building better environment & better home etc ...
village people could feel save & healthy .
would cost alot money .
think make sauri good place everyone jump even little bit donation .
agree artical saying whe could change poverty .
could give money working hard .
family could start working .
child could get food , good etc , book paper , pencil 's could write .
also could buy clothes would n't look bad

yes winning fight aganist poverty possible .
hospital helpful .
food , school hospital .

mean people always joyful together , people actually help also fun .
another example , people actually think accomplish need help goal .
example essay say goal get people poverty , assure ace health , stabilize economy .
reach goal actually think help .
last , think goal might achievable village supposed get thing like fertilizer , medicine , school supply .
think people actually help village get supply , help many thing need like farming , hospital , school .
yes , think able win war aganst provity lifetime .
little preparation hard work got sauri , kenya dump developing nation .
world pitch 'll able beat war !
thats pitching helping least working hard .

people think kenya good place project made , know medchina kid help treatment cure , people new cloth ware instead walking bare food , parent could work hard earn money .
know people built project , hope still 2015-2025 .

winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
two side argument people feel win fight within lifetime people n't .
issue important half people world live poverty .
people feel winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
first , winning fight poverty within lifetime n't possible poverty big issue long time .
people living poverty happening way born .
therefore , happening lifetime person still living .
ca n't le 100 year .
people may say sauri made amazing progress four year , win fight poverty .
however , sauri small village small population , argument invalid .
second , n't enough money help everyone living poverty .
many people right amount money live .
people help people living poverty , living poverty , .
opposing side may say enough money rich people chip .
n't agree many wealthier people already give lot money time help poorer people .
third , n't think winning fight poverty within lifetime possible many people need help .
50 % world population life le $ 2.50 day .
many people , really hard meet goal 2015 2025 .
others may say since dramatic change occurred 80 village across sub-saharan africa , possible poverty thing past .
disagree village part africa .
still poverty-stricken area africa around world .
people may say every single person earth help way , win fight poverty .
disagree point view people overtime make enough money family .
also , almost every single person way already helped people poverty .
yet , n't close winning fight poverty .
conclusion , n't think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime poverty happening long time , n't money , many people living poverty .
even though think ca n't win fight poverty lifetime , still think still help people poverty .

good amount money made could get supply would need living .
like example getting bed net , since 20,000 kid die daily .
also getting fertilizer would nice people could eat .
since crop would grow , part n't eat could help fertilize soil & keep healthy .

opinion , africa never self-sustainable without help u.s. ?
based natural surroundings village , farming n't look like option ?
fertilizer + little rain = bad crop .
hospital .
bad condition + unreasonable fee = 20,000 kid dying day .
see , africa , matter , sustain without constant foreign help .
africa recover life time , maybe 200-300 year .
big number ?
well , though condition improving , africa never civilized small time period .
within estimated time , make africa close civilization .
, say , get whole world contribute massive project .
africa many people even cheapest thing cost lot .
?
cheap item x ( big amount ) + shipping fee = need international financial help .
imagine shipping medicine .
maybe three time cost .
end , u.s. alone support africa constantly africa sustain , even given supply .
well , 's opinion .

three exampels- school system - hospitl - farmer
author article convinces audience change poverty made acheived time .
people village gone nothing education healthcare due help millenium village project .
however , way poverty money , help , time .
example , many family village 'could afford school fee ...
school minimal supply like book , paper , pencil , student wanted learn .
' four year , school village recieved supply needed donation millenium progect .
, impoverished family send child school lunch without fee .
healthcare also improved time .
first , village hospital even simplest tool medicine , many people died common disease .
year , hospital recieved medicine
author convince fight poverty achievable lifetime .
convinced progress sauri , kenya made four year .
also , optimistic goal millennium village project trying meet .
one reason author convinced hospital improved four year .
2004 , running water , electricity , three child bed two adult bed .
also , many patient would die medication needed available could n't afford .
2008 running water , electricity , medicine free charge , even patient ca n't afford medicine still get help .
goal reached four year .
also , many child attend school .
2004 limited supply fee school .
fee caused many child come school parent could n't afford .
also , lunch kid could n't concentrate school work .
help millennium village project 2008 school got supply needed , fee anymore , lunch served .
many kid go school .
another goal reached four year .
another reason 'm convinced people n't starving .
millennium villags project provided fertilizer villager could grow food family .
2004 people starving lack fertilizer water .
author show goal reached lifetime .
finally , malaria prevented .
people got malaria bed net .
bednets provided prevent malaria .
goal reached short amount time .

another example poverty farmer fertilizer keep crop live .
also water low farmer mean could n't water plant .
farmer worried enough food kid kid get hungry become sick .
school poor supply like book , paper , pencil student wanted learn .
student work hard supply .
midday meal kid n't energy school .
think help millenium village would give supply water crop .
think express feeling also gave example saw felt looking event .
one example people sauri kenya get really sick
ca n't afford buy net keep mosquito away give malaria also people sauri , kenya ca n't afford buy medicine get treatment need stay alive .
another example kid ca n't afford buy pencil , book paper .
another example family 's ca n't crop mean ca n't feed family ca n't afford fertilizer crop grow .

beneficial , problem many people school , learning , getting paper , book , lunch , whatever else , school would need find source pay demand .
kid already poor hard money even go community .
though , many may pay fund project , amount money limited problem may also arise .
another concern might occur would increase population .
written author , yala-sub district hospital medicine , free charge , common disease .
, people living protection food live population increase .
increase population , resource sustain life demanded , hard give .
district many ready enough sustain full population flimsy amount resorces .
one final problem may rise improvement sauri , kenya may government concern .

example 2004 , kid adult sharing bed .
also people dying preventable disease like malaria n't docters medcine treat patient .
hospital docters medicine , free charge .
also water electricty .
another example farmer planted crop , ca n't afford necessary fertelizer irragration .
fertelizers , seed tool maintain food supply .
last example child could get education parent could n't pay supply n't midday meal .
n't school fee school snow offer midday meal .
believe author convence u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime poverty , may think hope keep trying make progress even though might take succeed .

third reason family starving starving .
last reason building hospital need fixed 2015 2025 .
, many people still poverty right think like text say 'the goal suppose meet 2015 ' .
many people africa suffuring poverty 'malaria ' .
think bed net could really help survive malaria text say 'bed net thing hover bed protect misquitoes malaria .

first reason many place making dollar day .
three piece evidence 1.2 billion people dollar day , took 4 year help one village , there many place need help .
side might say could help everyone help .
might work cause 's like whole country second reason everyone money .
three peices evidence poor people ca n't help people wo n't donate , people ca n't contribute .

would get money .
last reason ca n't help .
three peices evidence might enough money , people mean , much people donate .
side might say make everyone donate .
could choose help .
people may say help .
disagree statment everyone could donate , like 60 year , 's like whole country .
think wo n't stop poverty lifetime .

although price buy bed net cheap , people many place nothing sell money , poverty , might usually le dollar day live .
quote prove section 'the fight better health ' stating , 'each net cost $ 5 .
second , place need food water .
many place might clean irragation fertilizer grow food .
simple , yet place might drought , even live compost like orange peel .
kenya example bad irragation crop .

' lastly , people need education knowledge .
education hard get , school fee people money .

yes , author convince 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime , '
author said patient n't recieve treatment either
hospital n't patient could n't afford , n't running water electricity , n't bed net
twenty thousand kid die day , farmer could n't afford necessary fertilizer irrigation , many kid sauri could n't afferd school
fee , school hard concentrate
midday meal .
changed four year , hospital medicine free charge , common disease , water , electricity .
fertilizer , seed , tool , school fee midday meal .
made think start preventing proverty age author sooner start , people could help .
think 'winning fight proverty achieveable lifetime .
'
convince winning fight poverty achievable even though n't everywhere , able get rid poverty .
4 year 80 village across sub-saharan africa , extinct poverty .
prof millennium project worked , fight poverty .
also prof lifetime still alive 4 year .
another thing prof could destroy proverty alot place lifetime helped amount village 4 year , 's 20 village , 80/4=20 .
could every year , maybe hundred year , could abolish poverty everywhere .
also another convince matter bad condition village , millennium project could fix .
example villiage story , sauri , kenya , really bad condition .
alot sick people , could n't cured n't money pay treatment .
plus could stopped getting sick , n't enough money buy thing prevent sickness .
people sauri , kenya made money , usually le $ 1 dollar day usually spent food , could n't buy anything else .
also family poor kid n't go school would stay home help chore .
besides , school n't provide lunch , n't much school suplies , end day child tired worn .
also , farm life n't great , crop n't grow well , farmer could n't afford right amount irrigation fertilizer plant .
plant would usual wither .
see , villiage horrible condition ,
millenium viliage project fixed people go school , good food , n't get sick often , make alot money , able fix year .
see matter bad look even lookes hopeless , fighting poverty achieveable liftime .
also prof milienium village project save villiages matter bad condition .
people able save 80 villiages le centry , usually live longer .
reason listed reason conviced fight proverty lifetime .
also think maybe decade 2 , even though thats life time might live hundred definetly 2 decade , could get rid poverty everywhere .
yes

hospital n't running water medicine .
people mostly would get malaria bad flu .
hospital could n't treat people ethier n't could n't afford .

kenya like good hannah sachs donated alot money .
donated money water electricity hospital , bed patient , medicne , bed net ( lot ) , fertilizer , irrigation , school suplies , lunch , kid going school .
think proverty avoided put heart .

donate money would help many way .
one way since people sauri n't enough money pay medication malaria disease .
since text said child die malaria disease becaus medication .
another way prevent malaria help buy bed net using money donated .

honestly think never happen lifetime 's ruining population growth hurting country barely money recover raise 1 dollar day .
yes made belive people making fundraser world greedy want people keep fighitng make world violance .
think world would safer people gave poor people resource need would le war gang .
kenya would safer hospital , police , money , school 100 people one class also need better book make school free people kenya .
start foundation like red cross hati foundation donate money thing need .
think usa wont help unless give usa something thats might happen .
usa wont help kenya africa unless benifis u give u money give u thing usa need kenya take .
yes , point veiw isand one reason improved everyday .
hannah visted 2004 hopsital didnt water electricity , kid running bare foot , te school low school supply , changed positive way .
still n't stop ot village still poor one village .
end hope everyone would join together save village becasue failing option .
think author think know life back sauri know fourtunate maybe make nation help make life better .
three thing sauri better hospital give medicine free charge common illness .
water hooked hospital wich also used generator .
also hunger crisis aaddressed fertelizer seed .
learned lot sauri donate money help .
oppinion author persuade stating winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
reason belive author n't give good statement hannah author suggests possibility could happen community work together instead actually bringing people together make difference .
furthermore also disagree suggestion fighting proverty acheivable lifetime author state
writter explains yala sub-district hospital year 2004 visited informs people i'ts hard see people preventable disease .
question people africa tryed fight disease malaria wich malerida could prevented
still finally conclued opinion stating author state process would complicated
ability 's disability would possible
many diseas able cure .
think could poverty read .
think could stop poverty africa turned around mostly people poor .
people africa spent $ 1 day could n't get anything $ 1 .
4 year really changed around .
could almost everybody lot money , better life .
really think could change poverty around state lot poor u changed poverty around four year .
money make big change faster .
try something like africa , could would really good .
also since could better .
think could change poverty would find way like africa .
think possible .
first world country help , could definitely happen .
america , $ 5 lot money .
'm sure person could donate $ 20 , people need bed net would plenty .
would help many people prevent getting malaria .
also , america , people wasteful food .
instead waiting something go bad , would better donate .
think would help stop world hunger .
also , water natural resource .
believe people right control , right make others pay .
everyone enough water , could make farm food , helping stop world hunger .
education another important thing .
child access good free school .
child n't know read , function well life ?
school enough supply textbook child learn .
education limited enough money go .
lot easy thing could make 'winning fight poverty ' possible .
peek_020023765 n't think 'the war poverty ' acheivable lifetime maybe acheivable childrens lifetime .

help 80+ village , would take way lifetime end poverty .
people may say volunteer start working faster , could disagree would n't enough time .
wanted finish life time , village would take 1 year , 24 % time took .
way many victim enough volunteer .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 day 115 million child enrolled school .
also , 20,000 people die malaria desease passed around mosquito day !
people may say plenty people willing volunteer disagree statement still many people need even million volunteer would n't end poverty lifetime .
people may say everybody helped , could end poverty 50 year .
disagree point view even everybody helped , would still take long time .
also everybody help .
selfish people world choose help .
n't think could end poverty liftime took 4 year help 1 village help way many village .
however , step improve situation .

winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
think win poverty ?
people think totally possible , others think much poverty .
6 billion people world 50 % live $ 2.50 le day .
think many people get everyone poverty .
lot people .
around 6 billion people worldwide 2.2 billion kid .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 per day .
much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
n't think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor person 's life .
definately change people 's life , everybody 's .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
ca n't conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference people 's life .
ca n't get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , n't enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyone 's life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people n't know people money .
even though ca n't change world , take step change life .
think older poverty would stop goverment would give job poor people san francisco .
could buy food , shoe , cloth suplyes .
school thei give better foo kid dont like food school .
stop grafity bus disrispectful people aroud u becase kid thy learn bus .
hospitalls , give medicine n't medicine .
good poor peaple .
fighting poverty achievable village assure people health care .
village also stabilizes economy quality life .
village provide fertilizer , medicine school supply .
hospital medicine free common disease .
hospital generator water electricity , school serve lunch student .
'is winning fight poverty achievable life ?
' 2012 1.2 billion people live le $ 1 day , 115 million kid world n't school go .
millenium organization help .
first thought everyone gave $ 1 would 7 billion dollar ( 7 billion people world ) , thought poor people , hoomless ca n't give money .
also think 50 % poverty levle .
even 50 % 3.5 billion dollar enough help whole world .
another reason think done barely save economy add problem .
detb china , china rich ca n't ask help u ( greedy much !
) .
others might say done rich people giving .
like example bill millinda gate , facebook founder , ect ...
disagree give much need alot .
last reason took 4 year 1 town .
imagine long would take let say africa .
africa poorest content wourld .
hold 15 country .
know ethiopia .
ethiopia people dieing thirst famin .
take 4 year 1 town , long take country ?
believe done people overpopulating poor family place unfourently poor .
1 step fix problem would help outer give big amount , big amount .
hope solved .
yes , read .
somebody fight poverty win .
ex .
took article 'a brighter future ' .
hannah sachs visited kenya .

another reason agree part people better health energy .
reason energy fertilizer plant get water , good thing kid n't got sick .
3 reason phrase convinced hospital get mor electricity witch every hospital need .
second thing get allot water , water electricity thing hospital need patient .
think achievable lifetime people sauri get better life 4 year easy get rid poverty lifetime .
millennium village project helping get people need live .
people sauri food electricity free medicine focus child getting education .
, text state , '20,000 kid die disease day .
' another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .
also medicine hospital free , supplied farmer water fertilizer , tool farm plant !
improved 80 village , think might make lifetime , could get money buy food trade country !
yes
article said help millennium village getting goal tell 's reach goal fight poverty also said kid need supply school
better get goal life .
people also need food help getting getting supply food , thats giving better life .
example convince life time winning fight poverty achievable long get help othes get need .
think think want people know kenya people help bring doctor , food , job people get money .
think back probly wasent lot bug : people probly food payed le thing .
day geting sick bug dont money pay thing .
reading article last pargraph author state winning fight poverty acheivable life time convinced
section better life - 2008 author listed bunch example sauri kenya improved , one example provided fertile soil kenya could grow crop .
also state running water electricity .
reading article know fact possible kenya improve people better life .
first read article , thought : 'no .
' article sauri poverty .
, reading 'a better live-2008 ' , think , yes .
course .
?
2004 2012 , already helped 80 village across sub-saharan africa .
, might think .
well , author first visited sauri 2004 , said yala sub-district hospital : 'it good shape , .the room packed patient probably could recieve treatment , either
hospital , patient could afford , .there doctor , .there running water electricity .
' 2008 , yala sub-district hospital free medicine , common disease , water , electricity .
's amazing much short amount time .
2004 , hannah went visit farmer , crop dying ; fertilizer water .
'every , farmer would plant seed , outcome poor crop lack fertilizer water .
' every year , farmer would worry enough feed family , child starve get sick .
2008 , thing started looking better , people gave fertilizer seed tool help maintain food supply .
'many kid sauri attend school , ' ?
well , one , parent probably could afford school fee , , two , little supply , , three , midday meal ; student would energy end day .
, sauri , school fee , school provides lunch .
, lot kid attend school sauri .
malaria also problem sauri .
mosquito carry malaria , bitten one , adult , would get sick ; child , die easily .
solution malaria , people probably could n't afford .
one solution bed net .
bed net treated special chemical keep mosquito away .
bed net cost $ 5 , people living sauri time living le $ 1 day .
also cheap medicine cure malaria .
, every sleeping site sauri , bed net keep mosquito away , would n't get malaria .
3 reason make sauri better , poverty free place .
everybody 's help , help kenya !
yes , 80 village saharan africa made kid school get lunch everyday .
fee going school .
money pay hospital .
runing water electricity hospital .
author convinced winning fight aganst poverty achievable lifetime .
'changes better ' united state , kid wake early five day week go school .
pack book take heavy bookbag school .
school come home grab quick snack watch television start using every electronic device .
's thing work everywhere world .
place like sauri , kenya child wake early everyday , go school ; clean cook family .
're lucky might get one meal .
's important child u.s aware happens poor country grateful try help .
twelve year old girl part millennium village project think .
author article want change world one step time .
go place like sauri help .
see hospital sauri 3 kid bed 2 adult bed know 's fair .
especially since doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
many patient waiting room wo n't get treatment hospital n't patient ca n't afford .
preventable disease still die poor hospital .
five year later , help millennium village project , treatment common disease bed , 's free .
kid aware .
farmer sauri could hardely grow enough food family due lack fertilizer irrigation .
, help , fertilizer seed available also tool needed farming .
child fed treated disease go school .
school n't used ; midday meal parent ca n't afford .
school free lunch .
also school supply .
's important know thing like .
kid united state aware change going around .
even n't affect .
aware lucky consider normal high-class compared place .
aware opportunity help .
think author agrees .
think able kill poverty
even 4 year possible make big change like running water , free medicen , light hospital , disesie place kill 2,000 kid day preventable cureable .
think possible .
yes .
author convince people africa need better life .
wo n't die without food shelter .
need money feed family .
example many kid sauri attend school parent could afford school fee .
really poor earned $ 1 day feed family .
saved money school die hunfer .
get sick ca n't afford medicine n't good doctor die .
author convinced winning fight poverty possible lifetime 80 village already making progress .
think many village help impoverished .
also sauri made lot progress already , village helped .
another example people sauri made lot progress four year , prof place africa helped .
farmer sauri already fertilizer irrigation enough food crop feed family .
people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .
kid think better lunch .
another reason lot people suffer disease prevented .
world provide medicine treat disease .
would say author convince 'winning fight poverty achievable , lifetime
think try succeed , mean people start donating thing like food , beverage , clean , uncontaminated water , clothing , medecines , money , shelter , hospit .
child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
important dirty water sicken kill people , fertilizer slow well quickly crop grows .
bet day people n't get fed .
help , take year fix .
example kenya n't enough fertilizer .
yes , convinced much work thru life time took goal young age acomplishing .
also know wanted/wants putting heart mind get sprout .
reason convinced kid .
mostly impoverished land people live , grow crop food/vegetation .
well kid live happily .
also convinced quote 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
' reason convinced throw lifetime got something make sprout turn tree everytime something good tree give fruit eat wont starve .
also , enjoys best helping people need n't anything eat sometimes , n't education .
might even food roof live always walking around naked barefoot around street .
mostly million people n't know dieing hunger , dieseases , coldness , maybe even love n't parents/family .
well food clothes shelter , people grateful anything possibly get .
really convinced talk help people n't care say n't time even thow really .
also inspired help help people need , need thing america
thinked achievable try .
win proverty help trust .
trust person helping ca n't achieve .
yes little-money & porr life , everybody rich & want .
was/am convinced winning fight aginst popvety achievable lifetime lifetime 's jsut good clothing 's health .
12 year old girl also convinced saying winnig fight aginst poverty achievable lifetime acully something think .
yes , achievable lifetime .
example , 4 year project hospital running water , electricity , nd free medicine people stay helahty would lot money make medicine free .
also millenium project provided supply like book , pencisl , thing school fee free common atend school free , school also ahd lunch provided attendance rate went soaring
kid energy keep working hard school .
millennium project also provided irrigation , fertlizer , tool farmer decrease starvation keeping food supply available people 4 year millennium project
youc ould achieve fighting poverty across world helping donate raise fund raiser everywhere help people like people sauri , kenya
convinced millennium project godo foundation helping epoeple eed help like peole africa need thing .
achieve poverty ?
n't think achieve poverty there much people world thats poverty .
issue important world poverty one reason n't think solve , many people .
around 1.2 million people poverty .
think ca n't achieve rich people donate money raise engouh money save everyone poverty .
secone , farmer n't engouh money buy fertilizer .
farmer n't fertilizer mean n't get food eat .
farmer going poverty buy fertilizer .
people always donate money farmer .
food farmer n't money .
soon , starving .
people may say save people whose poverpty .
disagree statement lot people need money .
n't think 4 year engouh time .
opinion problem achieve goal one million people whose poverty .
lot farmer n't money .
lot kid n't money go school .
lot diesed people ca n't afford money .
way improve telling people donate help proverty problem .
yes , winning fight agaist poverty achievable lifetime .
one example making millennium village project .
would made project n't think could make difference .
also would wasting money .
knew chance make differnce .
another reason dedicated making success .
determine actualy traveled kenya make change .
helped soothed people .
financaly emotionaly .
everyone poverty would word .
every person helped would better life .
one last reason made good progress year kenya .
kid could go school .
electricity hospital , water hospital .
common disease treated free , bednets .
poverty proplem changed .
every thing went well .
think winning fight agaist poverty possible lifetime .
everyone contribute thing would better .
people would healthier .
life would changed .
doubt already winning .
author argreement fair reasonable progress maintained year increas bednets 2008 water hospital also nonfeeds school meal day .
believe time adult suffring kenya progress going long .
hope older kenya project closed done best give best life .
even though kenya residence probelm soulds like one worst people nothing desverb .
yes , told 2004 food , water , suppies even doctor help sick .
four year past 2008 food , water , suppies doctor help sick , bad disease kid adult 's .
convince first told , 2004 thing really bad , 2008 thing got better like kid got food , water , suppies school .
also doctor help people sick disease .
know poverty lifetime .
specific example medcine thats sent stop disease day sad illogical .
disease spread night mosquito .
family starving farmer enough land harvest crop .
kid little bit supply , use supples usefully .
student attend school work parent enough money fee .
people started making progress .
yala destric hosipital medcine free .
drastic diseas cured .
school fee free .
many solution problem keep people impoverished .
said want type affect history .
think lifetime argument work read already convinced , author gave reason believe .
first , 2076 ( 'm 75 ) acheived africa , ( kenya ) poverty write start saving kenya money .
also , america pitch cure every diesease book .
, pay bed + toy + clothes kid .
another reason make sure child get nutrient + fiber need stay hydrated + make sure n't work .
finally - education article author said kid ca n't go school parent ca n't afford school fee .
somethings kenya need help .
yes , charity .
also yard sell .
feel bade people shoe cant afford .
want help get electricty .
really feel bad .
also donate important stuf like money live .
charity lot place like subway , target lot .
make lot money cause people go tehre .
lot people go .
buy stuff like water food send .
really want help .
need donate stuff .
get electricity give electricity sometimes n't need .
give like electricity company like pcpco .
america waistes electricity .
need right .
let use .
n't think author convinced winning fight poverty achieveable life time gaol set far away .
also one village getting support need .
another reason people becoming sick even dying .
goal far away cause people poverty harder time .
people poverty may feel life goal fartehr away help little later .
one village supported take care people .
parent child living poverty may want go village supported mean overcrowding soon begin .
people becoming sick dying happening fast one helping .
eral doctor help .

farmer plant many crop feed whole family sometimes worry n't enough fertilizer soil grow crop family .
went see hospital realized light electricity .
could n't see inside explore .

progress encouraging supporter millennium village project .
many solution problem keep people impoverished .
really take world work together change poverty-stricken area good .
easy task .
sauri 's progress show u winning fight poverty acheivable lifetime .
opinion , author convince winning fight poverty achievable .
reason opinion water problem easily solved , generator built little electricity , supply bought cheaply .
water hard obtain , irrigation system easily made .
growing crop would har water .
hospital clinic would hard water .
hospital clinic would need water wash hand disease would n't spread easily .
water people , living would difficult .
many acre world , little electricity use .
problem easily solved using thing like solar panel generate electricity .
using solar panel placed lot sun would great , sunnier , electricity produced .
electricity help place like school hospital learning treating people would easier .
many problem poverty-stricken area lack supply .
supply bought distributed easily .
example , mosquitoe net could brough $ 5 medicine malaria bought cheaply .
lack food could caused enough fertilizer , also could bought cheaply .
could buy supply cheaply , ca n't help others need .
yes author convince putting people poverty millennium village project sauri , kenya trying help people sauri sending supply school supply , water , medicine .
goal long one aim year 2015 goal worth since helping people poverty .
year 2008 school supply school hospital mechine supply running water electricity .
people sauri net prevent mosquito spreading malaria people .
next goal poverty end year 2025 .
would say yes , sauri village achieved lot 4 year .
even though think achieve goal , think 'll take 11 year .
maybe 'll finished 2017 .
support answer , example .
first , hospital free medicine formost common disease africa .
second , every sleeping site bed net prevent mosquito spreading malaria .
third , hunger crisis solved un providing village water , fertilizer , even tool growing maintaining crop .
lastly , since school free kid get lunch , attendance rate went .
, lot kid go school .
think millenium village possible , think 'll take 2016 2017 achieve goal .
needed better health live .
bed net chemical last five day stay health .
village poor cause water food eat .
yeah ever got sick .
fight better health hospital school stay health n't get sick disease .
hospital need doctor bed cause were't nothing .
water , fertilliz , knowledges-some farmer trouble crop water give live give food .
end , end help water , food stuff need live school , thats needed .
think important kid united state learn people kenya
might want help people live get better education , help people sick go good hospital
care , make sure alot people going die , also make sure people poor anymore
people able eat , go hospital many thing .
yes author convince showing 2004 running school suplies could n't eat lunch 4 year later bunch school suplies could afford mid-day meal .
2004 hospital 3 child 2 adult per bed could n't afford medicine afford medicine common disease free .
also also 2 kid per bed 1 adult per bed .
bed net used every bed site sauri water connected hospital also generator .
also hunger crisis adressed seed , tool need grow seed .
yes , author showed progress 4 year millennium village project .
past 4 year people increased quality hospital .
hospital medicine , free , water , electricity- millennium village ' school , lunch given student .
school also fee , student attend school .

poverty hard end think mabey 'm older change .
honestly think poverty wont end wont last either , im saying there poverty everywhere nomatter enough money world end poverty , poverty doesnt forever temporary .
like private school dont need paid scholarship kid le money .
student able show talent smart get scholarship .
thats think school district poverty increase school fee .
another idea stop poverty government provide healthcare thats cheaper people dont pay much family member die .
also think create shelter help homeless people get back foot get job drinking problem mabey help get rid problem .
believe becoming wealthy achievable people kenya work hard .
patient get far wealthy mabye move family else become succsesful life .
getting people poverty hard resource come .
water never run anywhere country , fertilizer crop corn vegetable .
crop dying sun baley water , becuase people need water else thell die dehidration school needed kenya else kid education .
may able read , write , learn history , math , science , run play sport , like kick ball rock .
kid die wondering get attacked eaten dangrous animal .
village help need succsesfuly achieving succses thev'e dreamed .
80 village growing .
malaria disease spread kenya point kid dying .
people need pay $ 5 fer net , therfore mosqitoes font spread disease .
bad thing people get paid $ 1 everday time 5 day pas late .
cheap medicine used people malaria , treated .
kid mostly treated medicine parent sacrifice life kid .
food mid day time day .
starvation problem .
getting wealthy sound unachievable country help become achievable help .
kenya wealthy achievable place village cant helped help situation .
people die hunger , malaria , mosquito bite every night , education learn .
kid arnt able learn well , wont becuase energy need food , die sleep .
author convince winning fight poverty achievable

, yes , sauri 's poverty/progress show u true achieve poverty sauri , kenya !
n't think getting rid poverty world achievable lifetime .
one reason took four year village africa get medicine , take time many place poverty able acheive .
believe enough people try commit maybe get close matter always poverty world .
another reason bringing fertilizer , medicine school supply take money .
people n't money buy foundation find money elsewhere people minimal supply .
finding money also take time .
people might poverty people ca n't give money either surviving .
third reason goal hard achieve need people help get necessary supply running .
people throughout world want help n't think people want give job time family ; take 4 year many people want give time life .

author 'll explain 3 example .
first reason kid get free education .
since parent kid could afford school fee , kid could get education .
way , school minimal supply midday meal child would come home energy empty belly .
millenium village project , kid could free education , midday meal , supply .
second reason lack good health sanitation .
3 kid 1 bed 2 adult 1 bed hospital , plus , nobody could afford fee .
also , running water electricity doctor clinical officer .
millenium village project changed everything water connected hospital , generator electricity , medicine free .
third last reason lack water , fertilizer seed .
planted seed , would water fertilizer plant unfortunetly made crop die .
mean would food family eat made starve .
millenium village project however , gave farmer fertilizer , seed , tool .

however , biggest one corruption .
loss money could dramatically change outcome fight .
people see city fine , stop supporting .
, people see le progress , day day , month month , & c .
& c .
people see loss progress begin doubt win fight .
doubt grows bigger , people stop supporting .
le supporter , loss money .
cycle start .
price another variable change outcome fight .
price rise , shortage money .
shortage money , doubt .
said , cycle losing money continue .
, biggest change outcome corruption .
people organized project die .
new people take .
new people corrupt , use money selfish need .
use little bit money , greed take .
time , greed effect , absolutely $ 0 give poor .

medicine also 2004 little bit child school ,
2008 life lot better child much better education
supplices school hospital also big change n't net bed 2004

hospital 's share white another person .
hospital thers alot doctor help .
hospital thers water electricity .

ther 's still people n't think evry year getting better .
author 's article convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
2008 people sauri made amazing progress four year .
winning war poverty n't really possible .
however , people think possible .
first , lot people world feed .
also , far people eat food could 've given starving people .
next , people donate food .
first , alot people world feed .
n't really enough food world feed everyone .
leaf lot people hungry .
mean starving people stay hungry .
consequently , argue n't enough food keep everyone healthy .
also , fat people eat food could 've given starving people .
keep people hungry .
think provery life time .
text snice two thousand four proverty worst got better time .
example 2004 - provery bad people geting sick aford go hospital .
2004 - student school even money get school supplines 2008 - life geting little better parent aford school supply school get lunch .
think important kid united state lean life kin ya kid help country problem , know country problem help country .
millennium village project , wemen sitting dusty ground selling banana little kid running around bare foot waring torn clothing .
hospital , 3 kid bed two adult bed .
people probably would receive treatment becase could afford hospital treatment .
doctor , running water , electricity .
farm , crop dying could afford fertilizer water .
school many kid could afford school could attend school .
school minimal supply like book , paper , pencil .
student wanted learn though .
student worked hard little supply .
could concentrate ther lunch .
kid energy end day .
millenniun village project , people started donating thing sauri .
hospital medicine common disease .
connected water hospital .
hospital generator electricity , every sleeping site bed net used .
enough fertilizer seed plant food .
also new tool farming .
school fee lunch student .
reason important kid u.s. .
people wealthy need step people would donate enough money .
millionaire start caring abut people .
guy enough money make difference .
also , rich people could start donating supply n't need .
author convinced able convince richer people .
could donate fertilizer sauri able grow crop .
fertilizer important growing crop .
make soil richer nutrient plant grow .
since people sauri little money , really crop feed family .

child must able learn .
without necessary material unable learn .
thats important donate supply .

well , author convince 'winning fight poverty achieable life ' africa child got sick died , child young needed bed net .
needed food much farm , crop dieing .

right fight poverty achieable life ' .
last least last example fight poverty adult child got bitten mosquito killd chemical body .

think author think 's important kid learn life like kenya milennium village project kid learn life sometimes like around world .
like mosquito carry malaria , people able get treatment something happen .
poisoned mosquito bite someone become poisoned ca n't afford pay treatment .
suffer dying .
'a big awakening ' read article 'a brightr future ' , think american kenyan shoe kenyan shoe .
would make big difference world .
think important kid america learn life like kenya spoiled compared keyans , like come united state would n't see unpaved dirt road .
would likely see tall building perfectly paved road .
kenyan saw way lived big awakening .
another example lot kenyan people get sick easily go hospital share bed n't even doctor , administrator .
year hospital gotten better like free medicine common disease like malaria come mosquito .
last example farmer crop n't grow well grow enough family .
even sometimes 's enough .
year gotten fertilizer seed well tool help gardening , also kid going school school fee .
kid united state read story , life change forever 'll know everywhere rich soil rich road hospital .
also know helping little bit mind could something big kenya .

20,000 kid die disease day .
people sauri get sick die n't enofe waterm food , medicine ot school fee .
2008 tjings change example ahve medicine water hospital .
think author convince winning fight poververty acheivable lifetime sauri , kenya .
author mentioned easy solve basic problem happening sauri , kenya like malaria health problem .
problem like water , health , fertilizer education important problem .
think would easy winning fight poverty 4 year dramatic change occured 80 village accross sub-saharan africa .
plan get many people poverty possible .
people recieving health attention need .
many people dying disease always prevented .
running water , electricity hospital .
room packed patient wont get treatment need cant afford .
malaria common treatable preventable disease africa carried mosquito .
kid die adult get sick easly .
mosquito carry malaria come around night .
bed net treated chemical last to5 year prevent malaria cost 5 dollar .
yet thousand kid still dying 're living 1 dollar day afford .
another problem common africa water , fertilizer education .
everyday farmer plant grow crop try prevent dying lack fertizers irrigation needed .
kid go school lack money pay fee .
minimum supply midday meal making hard concentrate .
help sauri , kenya recieved many people getting help medical treatment needed .
school fee school serve lunch .
hunger crisis addressed fertilizer seed well tool needed maintain supply .
dramatic change occured throughout country africa well .
think achievment possible people trying stop poverty .
might want help people afford bed net .
right , around 80 village gotten better life .
also trying change area got 'poverty-stricken .
' might go better disease common , free .
generator getting electricity water flowing hospital .
school lunch change happened , lunch utensil school .
, also dont pay school fee .
farmer family fertilizer grow seed make crop .
four year ( 2004-2008 ) , helped 80 village .
farmer scared year ago enough food make family survive might farmer child get sick hunger .
net cost 5 dollar get 1 dollar day maybe .
bed net help keep misquitoes malaria bite give people night sleeping .

alot people sick one help .
2002 kenya made imporvement .
hospitles doctor .

author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
one reason didnt convince ti didnt give enough detail .
one village need almost 12 year fix 'simple problem ' state thea rticle , long going take get whole world poverty-free .
also long lifetime .
cant set solid due date thing like take time .
often problem rise .
right 's malaria , fertilizer , water , education .
new problem come place .
said article 'villages get technical advice pratical item fertilizer , medicine , school suplies .
local leader take .
' message received sentence 'we give need , , 're ' never mentioned project keep providing village need .
although made good point lot progress made people living better ...
happens 5 year bed net lost chemical factor , fertilizer gone , book worn longer useable ?
going ?
project going come back second time help ?
like begining article said , 're living le $ 1 day .
, village , one continent , village , continent .
going helped .
also money coming .
nothing done without money .
donor ?
'donors ' able continually donate money project .
w/ho people volunteering actually go impoverished place ?
many un-answered question , honestly say agree poverty deminished lifetime article .
need said .
reading article mellenium village project kenya , reader may convinced poverty end 2015 .
following paragraph explain think .
author 's writing completely professional .
often used improper grammer asked question answer .
one example said 'the attendence rate way .
' improper grammer , n't give reliable statistic .
author unproffecional writing show may reliable .
another reason reader may convinced author irrationally large statement .
one statment 'winning fight poverty achivable lifetime .
' may possibly true , well supported .

one reason health condition originally ahd .
hospital 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
room full patient would recieve treatment , n't money hospital .
addition poor condition actual doctor clinical officer .
worst thing n't running water electricity .
second , disease .
malaria common disease africa preventable ant treatable .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year repels mosquito .
despite average 20,000 child die year malaria .
food hunger .
sauri crop dying lack water fertilizer .
family plant many seed crop even barely successful .
every year farmer worry enough food feed whole family kid go hungry become ill .
last education problem .
sauri lot child attend school , paretns could afford school fee .
another reason child chore .
school minimum supply book , paper , pencil .
school midday meal child energy .
reason think winning fight poverty lifetime possible .
believe poverty combatable average lifespan .
although extremely unlikely immense problem solved approximately 70-80 year .
believe poverty sauri poor place suitable human life , considering sauri 's amazing improvement 4 year , relatively small compared human 's average lifespan .
poverty abolished problem solved disappear , problem seem appear go away .
destruction simpler creation , believe poverty dealt away perfect near perfect condition .
also natural problem global warming shortage problem .
human evil greed cause people commit crime , end helping poverty .
believe evil held back forever , good .
poverty may disappear come back way .
poverty also different form .
country-wide poverty focused local poverty .
local poverty another problem , although extreme .
le focused .
believe poverty kept bay ; maybe long time .
, inevitably , disaster come along destroy , slope downward .
believe poverty crushed near non-existency , find way back world .
suther convince possible overcome poverty people job give money help live .
know people helping
n't think achievable life time .
3 reason n't think people n't care , people think 's waste time , life short .
people n't care caught life .
also , people want money n't care people .
people n't care whats happening earth whats happening .
people think 's waste time already many people effected .
human age network .
human caught electronics forget suffering people kenya .
think life short change happened .
though age young damage already done great .
's think 's achievable beat proverty life time .
think put end poverty ?
well .
example think putting end poverty lifetime acheivable follow millenium 's lead .
got story village called millenium .
village many crop , little school kid , average pay one dollar day , hospital three kid bed much medicine .
milennium improved 's hospital took 4 year .
improved hospital medicine , ant charging go hospital .
help people get job millenium instead sick time .
put mind help people get chance get job .
millenium also improved 's school school suplies zeroe fee go school .
child attending school millenium .
school like rest world , people know .
people job .
one easy way stop poverty .
suprisingly even good fertilizer make difference .
reason fertilzer help plant grow people millenium food .

keep become good .
also think would easy sauri 's progress show u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
millenium village project sauri , kenya made help people .
one way giving bed net chemical repels mosquito infected milaria .
also help giving fertilizer farmer .
project kid died milaria .
farmer crop would die poor get fertilizer .
kid would usually waer tattered cloth part mom 's clothing .
hospital used running water electricity .
would always full three bed kid two bed adult .
patient would n't even even get treated n't medicine .
also doctor clinical officer .
also kid could n't go school proverty could n't pay school .
, kid school would distracted lunch .
project one proverty everyone got bed net .

author good job showing helping take much money .
example , tell reader help prevent malarial could pay $ 5 .

sauri , bed net used every sleeping site .
also food issue addressed giving fertilizer , seed resource needed keep steady food supply .
school also fee , serve lunch attendace rate high .
've managed short period time think work .
winning fight proverty achievable life time .
one reason many people thing n't need house .
simply donate item n't need .
example sibling growing n't need toy , donate child need .
donate clothes proverty .
might enough money buy warm clothing winter .
2nd , people volunteer cooking proverty .
proverty might never tasted food volunteer cook .
3rd , people donate money donation program help build newer building school child need really badly afford school .
agree author person said poverty eradicated .
one detail four year already medicine common disease irrigation water electricity .
another detaili fertilizer water better healtheir crop .

think 2025 small amount poverty left world .
80 village become town 's city two .
people getting amazing miracle .
winning fight poverty achievable lifetime !
convinced 'winning fight poverty achievable life time ' since 2004 2008 , four year made great progress .
hospital medical treatment disease , water electricity connected hospital , probably doctor & nurse .
every sleeping site sauri bed net used .
farmer fertilizer seed , well anything else farming supply school fee provide lunch student .
goal achieved help sick togother .
wo n't easy task done , worth time make earth better place .
yes , lot example 's went way help themso put hart .
example : said paragrath 3 .
seet goal 2015 village poverty .
alsosaid disliked sick people getting treated shea also said child could go school fee tey eductation .
another reason convince thought donate money thousand dollar help whole village lot people need help .
need education , medcine , money , ect , .
read article sad belive people go .
child still n't understand .
think one day village make ever live like .
one day would want donate cloth , shoe lot .
belive get edcutionas free .
fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe took sauri , kenya 4 year recover .
order sauri achieve goal cut back school fee , bed mat everyone , hospital finally water electricity .
took 4 year fix sauri , every village might take 4 year .
many town poverty would take year year .
also say ca n't acomplish happens city helped loses supply , run .
like sauri running fertilizer .
keep replenish supply , town n't really becoming poverty-free .
ca n't help single town forever .
fix one town cost thousand dollar , whole bunch supply .
many town poverty , spend even money .
job n't impossible , ca n't fix one lifetime .
addition sauria electricity scarce cost lot money replenish .
addition fertilizer , food , clean water bill , electricity add cost everything .
know 're million dollar 1 town .
many struken poverty town would hard .
united state alone ca n't come money .
country world contribute cause , might able .
lastly n't believe ca n't abolish poverty whole world , country n't want contribute .
selfish , race issue .
country put aside , might able .
, take many , many year complete big work .
, work together world .
might able see lifetime , may see couple town become poverty -free .
say yes 12 year old girl believe .
think wining fight poverty geat idea
cd n help people n't havs stuff need like crop peaople want grow
n't right fertilizer irrigation
ca n't afford
ther crop sarted die
food eat .
also help stay away safe malaria e killl kid make adult sick tape diseas africa mosquitioes carry bodyies .
many kid sauri school supply .
's 3 reason wa n't think great idea .
many thing poverty people .
many reason poverty people .
example , people sauri affected poverty issue school , hospital .
later reason winning fight poverty acheivable .
first explanation people sauri need help healthcare , stabilize economy , quality community .
reason village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply dont get enough .
another explanation hospital called yala sub-district hospital many hospital bed either 3 child 2 adult .
hospital run clinical officer doctor building .
running water electricity ; however , used water near river lake .
think winning fight poverty acheivable .
could send material u.s. china japan help .
researcher could bring supply sauri africa help whole sub-continent africa .
could also bring doctor teacher u africa hire school hospital .
agains poverty hurting people suffering people africa .
think win fight poverty power , power help .
sum poverty hurt people 20,000 people die due poverty .
help win 2015 2025 due plan .
think author make presentable argument think possible acheive thse goal , lifetime .
make good argument last two paragraph , really convonvinced agree point view .
presented great argument first page , using fact opiions really played emotion made feel sorry people kenya .
article sort upsetting section , better life-2008 cheered motivated wat help keep progress .
feel like maybe still hope co people kenya depsite problem ha solution yet , life improving .
really like pasage inform happening planet also made want take action .
last page alone made feel like repsonsibility learn kenya see help individual .
article convinced agree author encouraged keep progress motivated want help .
, definitely think possible achieve goal , put mind .
author convinced wining fight proverty life time beginning ?
project people sauri could barely pay school lived dollar day could n't afford bed net keep away miquitoes maleria .
2008 millennium village project helped ever medision bed net hospital regular house clean water provided hospital agenirator provide electricity hospital kid go shool free charge hunger
crisis addressed seed fertilizer fresh crop .
two million project tall people sauri crack water efficient hospital treat common disease .
think say use bednets kid alduts wont get malaria .
basicly saying made bednets provent malaria .
think author went people sauri n't alot money survive $ 1 le day , said also n't alot school suplies book , pencil , paper .
n't mid-day meal water .
thing happens like child get sick adult get sick .
may enough money go hospitle may get treatment .
wanted point 20,000 kid die day malaria .
said room fuller ther 3 kid abed 2 adult abed .
patient would get treatment didnt enough money pay fee .
kid didnt even go school parent could n't pay fee , think needed maintain food suplies .
thing , person telling story ( 12 year old ) spasific happenend , , survied didnt , year , state city .
author convince something similar happened diseabled think improved like .
one example show improve work together improve also working together change poverty-stricken area good .
also progress enouraging supporter milennium vilages .
also people sauri made amizing change last four year .
would argue 'winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ' several reason .
first , people n't good hospital right medicine , farmer n't fertilizer , irrigation system set , child could n't afford go school .
hospital really bad place like sauri .
n't proper doctor , running water electricity room packed sick patient .
several people shared bed know many bed room .
patient died hospital either n't right medication could n't afford .
'doctor ' really clinical officer .
farmer n't enough crop dying .
n't proper fertilizer n't enough seed .
also n't irrigation system set .
since alot people live dollar day farmer probably n't enough money able afford right tool , need get good crop .
last , family pay kid go school learn could .
n't know much school cost based attendance rate n't cheap .
school kid n't even get lunch .
end day kid really tired hungry .
four year dramatic change throughout sub-saharan africa .
hospital medicine free , water electricity .
bed net prevent malaria .
think important kid know graceful .
everyone clothes tattered .
sometim n't even shoe .
also kid know change got better .
exsuase ever kid go school longer pay fee .
everyone bed net prevent mosquito carry malaria .
hospital medicine free charge water electricity .
lot change .
author convinced think winning fight poverty achieveable lifetime .
one reason say cause 2004 school fee 4 year later .
also 20,000 kid die disease n't hospitality gain help , running water electicity .
sauri school n't access lunch supply , access lunch sauri kid teach lead people get education .
happened 4 year without entire world , believe done 2015 , everybody world contributes .
4 year fighting poverty made big difference sauri , kenya .
millenium villafe project made huge difference society sauri .
think poverty stopped .
since made big difference 4 year .
made medicine free everyone cure disease sickness .
water electicity running hospital .
farmer could grow crop neeessary tool , fertilizer , seed .
kid educated since school fee .
kid also go home energy since lunch provided .

school africa never free child house work instead .

like rice , water , supply , money fall sky .
plus poverty poverty .
nobody know another person feel thing .

anything possible set mind .
yet take year year everyone world poverty .
every single day someone loses house car still debt .
possible trying reach everyone endless struggle .
able afford many able win .
yet trying reach everyone send chaos people .
poverty endless struggle , loser winner .
fighting everyday life .
probably think different everyone pleased .
one rotten apple spoil bunch .
yet kill many .
think probable almost impossible win fight poverty .
one article , said one village poor people earned le one dollar day .
people medecine , fertilizer little school supply .
took lot money four year even improve sauri .
think would take lot money , time people improve poverty .
poverty almost impossible fight ton place world poor .
took 4 year sauri poor .
would need lot money get fertilizer , medecine supply place .
people want spend money ipads computer lot fplaces n't even electricity .
article said 20,000 kid dying malaria .
solution cheap medecine bed net .
bed net cost $ 5 , wanted get bed net everyone everywhere , would extremely expensive .
also expensive get medical supply , running water , electricity doctor every hospital .
n't think possible win fight poverty time soon .
article tell heart-warming inspiring story young girl 's visit sauri , kenya .

end , author state sauri 's progress show u winning fight poverty achievable lifetime..
one agree .
first , mechanic technology help .
sauri , unpaved dirt road , people walking bare-footed , people tattered clothes .
many others could help .
could pave road , make shoe , make clothing .
thing somewhat inexpensive done quickly easily .
secondly , could volunteer spend coupld month cook food people sauri .
article state people living le $ 1 day .
people sauri need multiple thing $ 1 wo n't get thing .
least could help food problem .
another problem sauri malaira .
malaria disease commonly found mosquito .
easily prevented treated medicine bed net .
since easily dealt , , think help disease .
could send syrinx bed net sauri .
also , problem hospital .
hard believe 3 child bed .
'm done yet , running water , electricity , doctor !
's sad ca n't docter hospital .
could donate bed , plumbing , generator , doctor instant .
lastly , problem school .
school appropiate material start day .
student still want learn .

everyone would need could live like human .
, ca n't achieve lot people world .
lot adult child never medical help family could n't afford .
sickness got wait stay home gone .

paients hospital could n't get right treatment could n't afford treatment needed .
even hospital doctor , clinical officer n't think officer anything likely heal people disease would die fast .

winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
millenium village project working reach millenium development goal kenya .
say fight poverty lifetime , others disagree .
need know millenium development goal achieved within certain amount time .
think ca n't get rid poverty , , make big difference .
ca n't get rid poverty took 4 yr achieve progress sauri , one village billion people live poverty , village 200-500 people .
million village size .
solve problem , multiple village time , right ?
, would take lot people resource , n't .
secondly , impossible poverty , everyone living poverty , people would still live better would become new poverty .
others argue everyone good living condition , poverty .

n't enough water , money , medicine prevent .
people needed $ 5 net prevent .
people got help author said : hospital medicine free charge , preventable disease .
's one way happen .
another example fertilizer crop problem .

believe 70 proverty still going .
answer proverty beaten iõm 70 take really long time .
first reason kenya proverty country proverty .
many country 50 state took four year kenya country recover .
50 time four two-hundred take really long .
second reason many people need help donõt much time state country people living long gone .
little late .
even hannah thought kenya bad envirment .
third reason people going raise enough money 50 state lot country one state .
take really long time place raised money save country proverty .
fourth reason people keep saving money country become proverty proverty going long time say going ever .
proverty hard prevent happening every country country .
fifth reason hard right think might happen afterward .
proverty make thing hard people live example kenya earn $ 1 day canõt find money themselve plus child .
five reason proverty might still going even turn 70 .

òthe people sauri made amazing progress four yearsó since 2004-2008 .
hope people sauri better year .
child sauri able go school school supply achieved .
someday everony world wonõt poverty .
òmaking changeó think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity òfund raiseró kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back itõs foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenyaõs poverty , think itõs unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money donõt want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country arenõt poorest country .
theyõre alot better everything .
yes .
think yes life like nwo sauri could imagine itõs like future .
could also determine future village .
enough thing need finished sauri finished four year would probably able different village .
author convince winning fight proverty life time acheivement .
think even give food water fertilizer every thing still going run eventually .
going need stuff .
eventually going able sleves .
also need teacher doctor .
people wnat become teacher doctor educated .
unpaved dirt road made car jump traveld millennium village sauri kenya .
reached village , walked bar sauri primary school meet people .
welcoming music singing almost everyone dancing .
year 2004 , first time ever sauri .
help millennium village project , place would change dramatically coming year .
millennium village project created help reach millennium development goal .
plan get people poverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quaility life community .
know story community childrens help learn , kid go school get high grade , chore parent .
thatõs kid something good important .
family homeless .
parent need take care kid donõt find food water kid become sick .
kid sauri attend school parent afford school fee .
kid needed help chore , fetching water wood .
author convince winning fight againts poverty achevable lifetime
2004 , poverty taking sauri
four year later electricity , running water , medicens put hospital , parent longer pay child go school also eat lunch .
also bed net every bed 80 village mosquito carry malaria n't bite people make sick .
2004 sauri n't good .
hospital small electricity , running water , ran clinical officer .
malaria killed 20,000 kid day made adult qick .
buy bed ned $ 5 people poor , could afford later get sick .
people sauri would farmer lot crop would die dont fertilizer , farmer dont food family family would hungry child would sick starvation .
people american n't go ,
people city , state , even country around would go poverty people around world doesnt even know
team could probably fight poverty get away good .
stuck poverty would want help people .
come together help like people helped villager sauri , africa .
yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wonõt die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
possidle stop poverty complety .
one example people getting born ever se mean ther le fod upoming people mean provety might increase .
second example economy money wasted war easily .
third reason help countrises countrises might get atteck lose money strat help .
fourth reason limtet stuff could give since preety broke .
winning provety acheivable lifetime money sometime something everyone need money something waste , use wisely .
many state , country , continent city poor .
somehow think place called kenya poor place told child mother back , running around tattered clothes tattered mean riped torned apart .
kinda like lifetime many homeless people sitting street .
also like city , san francisco , lottery place many adult teenager go lottery ticket might win lottery ticket .
achievable fighting provety also good thing place like lottery place help .
also person help mostly money saving company .
agree winning provety achievable lifetime many provety , people known poor people government priesdent help achieve goal term .
serious problem author persuaded think helping africa think helping millenium villageõs project .
africa populated people need help care , something donõt .
malaria common disease africa causeing people depressing life .
example , people sleep chemicalized bed net .
also , work outside , probably causing get malaria , get money use health supply .
impoverished another main problem africa .
poverty causing child miss education need become better .
farmer grow crop need eat , survive .
africa trouble becoming sick impoverished .
millenium village project may help , might enough .
thse serious problem , well fighting better health .
life improved work hard study hard pacient three thing sec life .
also wait keep winning stand self stand others .
one thing never something thats leagle never steal stuff get trouble .
think winning fight aganist poverty achievable lifetime help 1,000 people sauri kenya .
plan get people proverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
give better clothing ragged clothing wear every single day .
passage paragraph 9 state sauri kenya people better life connected water line hostipal even electricity light .
get help geting 1 dollar day buy net wont get bitten night miquoetos carry disease called malria child wont get dieases killem even adult .
help farmer water fertilizer .
help sauri kenya achievable thing lifetime .
writing prompt think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó determination , strength millennium village project .

based passage read , think winning fight poverty possible
believe matter amazing progress make next hundred year , always people richer others always people selfish .
people selfish , acutally believe could actually fight poverty , fact one selfish .

hospital patient could afford it.ó qoute show selfish people actually
always help people rich .
even selfish , donõt think possible win fight poverty .
people think could actully win fight poverty technology getting better better , disgreed even technology getting better dosenõt mean people change .
people smart .
know good .
eventually people gon na get smarter smarter time go .
esample text said òthe people made amazing progress four year , water connected hospital , also generator electricity.ó text show people getting smarter .

like said òeach day 20,000 kid die malaria.ó providing medicine food people would cost lot money .
would take lot people world improve poor country .
plus text say 20,000 kid die day .
count year even month would lot kid .
even though said people sauri made amazing progress .
still think couldnõt heal provide food every single people .
many village africa havenõt gone .
said òthey gone 80 village across sub-saharan africaó .
say sub-saharan africa .
bet everyone every part africa suffering .
take money support oter country .
soon would bankrupt .
unless everyone chip bit .

yes , author convinced winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
text say plan get people poverty assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply .
goal supposed met 2015 , target set 2025.we halfway 2015 , world capable meeting goal .
think poverty eliminated generationõs lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri didnõt simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u werenõt avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people couldnõt afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri didnõt go school .
found werenõt enough thing book pencil .
majority student didnõt eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
believe òwinning fight povertyó achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine isnõt high people able donate reasonal amount money help peopleõs life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wonõt grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , wouldnõt live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri donõt hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also didnõt midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
donõt get privilages , believe change .
yes author convinced fight proverty achievable already started .
know achievable already started helping hospital , school , crop .
helped problem mosketoes made medicine got infection made bed net people dont get disease .
anothe way kid dont amout money sent thier child school sent school
didnt food
end day child dont right amount energy need
payed food give .
people even gae furtalizer people village .
even though done much every body !
together .
purpose paper identify based article author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say yes put part like work together help sauri , keny trust believe change poorness able better education way better doctor hospital .
say text said hospital n't water electrisity .
past year work make better water electrisity keep working keep working make even better .
chance change poorness would kid way better future better education .
reason say reading artical made think fair like alot thing still think enough kid nothing compare .
chance go help would , would anything thats possible help kid get better education help get clos shoe .
( back question ) yes think author story support point view see people made big differances life .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think author think imortant kid learn keya sould happy maidsend & sand & changed .
kenya , 20,000 kid die every day , cure also , people fell sad & ill .
inset pay 5 $ sud save line .
kenya cure lot people die fron doctor heple work togeter fix
author convince fight poverty 2008 hospital medicine fight disease , also water connected hospital , generator electricity .
school started supply student , lunch , school fee , attendance rate .
example something seems hard impossible never let go fail fall , canõt give got get keep trying till suceed .
village millennium thought compliting goal going hard accomplish .
noticed tried hardest work together could accomplish impossible stuff could turn possible stuff .
kenya could accomplish something seemed impossible canõt something challenging ?
yes , agree author life millennium village sauri kenya improved
author article hannah sachs actually went kenya saw poverty like enough money bed net people kenya started getting malaria improvment shown like bed net medicine
sauri , kenya improved .
believe sauri improved like fertilizer irrigation also medicine yala sub-district hospital .
shown load improvement attendence school .
òit gone way upó like author say .
disagree author òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó point hardly money .
economy low .
thousand thousand poverty always .
doesnõt seem logic realistic one day would poverty .
many thing need improvement make little improvement make big difference .
donõt see fight poverty achievable point world .
agree author sauri place shown improvement keep showing improvement everyone help .
know isnõt going happen different type people donõt even care going care money .
never change .
conclusion believe since economy bad alot selfish people donõt want help number poverty .
believe fight poverty occur .
show little improvement make big difference hope one day poverty .
donõt think goal need date 2015 .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
itõs mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri didnõt even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply donõt money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet itõs affecting people donõt five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food itõs impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed cropsõ growth farmer also donõt extra money .
winning poverty isnõt impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime isnõt enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
òhelp comingó author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference todayõs society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor canõt afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid donõt really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid donõt much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food donõt buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people donõt enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people canõt afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wonõt share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .
article convince .

2 ) chidren got school could pay stay help his/her parent .
energy got home couldnõt get lunch school .
3 ) farmer didnõt money keep crop alive many people could get food .
example # 1-3 1 ) hospital medicine free genorator keep hospital powered .
everywhere sleeping place bed net .
2 ) child go school .
lunch school fee .
3 ) farmer money care crop hunger crisis preety much .

beneficial , problem many people school , learning , getting paper , book , lunch , whatever else , school would need find source pay demand .
kid already poor hard money even go community .
though , many may pay fund project , amount money limited problem may also arise .
another concern might occur would increase population .
written author , yala-sub district hospital medicine , free charge , common disease .
, people living protection food live population increase .
increase population , resource sustain life demanded , hard give .
district many ready enough sustain full population flimsy amount resorces .
one final problem may rise improvement sauri , kenya may government concern .
new change , government need change adapt new number population/growth/economy/etc .
go , everything positive change may affect people , harmfully .
change damaging could create giant problem .
overall , believe goal accomplished amount time given .
possible get better economy-wise population-wise believe time , improvement slow , giving enough time finish complete goal .

three kides abed .
also two adult bed .
rom packed patient probably would recive treatment , either hospital patient could afford .
doctor , clinical office running preventable disease people whoa near death shouldnõt .
running water electricity .
mosquito carry malaria .
many kides sauri attend school parent cant afford go school .

ending proverty stop people suffering day continue .
sauri , kenya , villager get $ 1 day buy little food need .
sick people share bed leading people get infected easily .
child try learn little supply , donõt eat providing energy body .
hospital limited amount medicine .
much plant grow dessert thereõs water .
proverty actually ruin many life .
winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
think win poverty ?
people think totally possible , others think much poverty .
6 billion people world 50 % live $ 2.50 le day .
think many people get everyone poverty .
lot people .
around 6 billion people worldwide 2.2 billion kid .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 per day .
much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
donõt think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor personõs life .
definately change peopleõs life , everybodyõs .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
canõt conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference peopleõs life .
canõt get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , donõt enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyoneõs life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people donõt know people money .
even though canõt change world , take step change life .
, text state , ò20,000 kid die disease day.ó another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .
also medicine hospital free , supplied farmer water fertilizer , tool farm plant !
improved 80 village , think might make lifetime , could get money buy food trade country !
yes
article said help millennium village getting goal tell 's reach goal fight poverty also said kid need supply school
better get goal life .
people also need food help getting getting supply food , thats giving better life .
example convince life time winning fight poverty achievable long get help othes get need .
yes , 80 village saharan africa made kid school get lunch everyday .
fee going school .
money pay hospital .
runing water electricity hospital .
author convinced winning fight aganst poverty achievable lifetime .
author convinced winning fight poverty possible lifetime 80 village already making progress .
think many village help impoverished .
also sauri made lot progress already , village helped .
another example people sauri made lot progress four year , prof place africa helped .
farmer sauri already fertilizer irrigation enough food crop feed family .
people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .
kid think better lunch .
another reason lot people suffer disease prevented .
world provide medicine treat disease .
would say author convince òwinning fight poverty achievable , lifetime
think try succeed , mean people start donating thing like food , beverage , clean , uncontaminated water , clothing , medecines , money , shelter , hospit .
child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
important dirty water sicken kill people , fertilizer slow well quickly crop grows .
bet day people n't get fed .
help , take year fix .
example kenya n't enough fertilizer .
yes , convinced much work thru life time took goal young age acomplishing .
also know wanted/wants putting heart mind get sprout .
reason convinced kid .
mostly impoverished land people live , grow crop food/vegetation .
well kid live happily .
also convinced quote òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetime.ó reason convinced
throw lifetime got something make sprout turn tree everytime something good tree give fruit eat
wont starve .
also , enjoys best helping people need donõt anything eat sometimes , donõt education .
might even food roof live always walking around naked barefoot around street .
mostly million people donõt know dieing hunger , dieseases , coldness , maybe even love donõt parents/family .
well food clothes shelter , people grateful anything possibly get .
really convinced talk help people donõt care say donõt time even thow really .
also inspired help help people need , need thing america
thinked achievable try .
win proverty help trust .
trust person helping ca n't achieve .
yes , winning fight agaist poverty achievable lifetime .
one example making millennium village project .
would made project n't think could make difference .
also would wasting money .
knew chance make differnce .
another reason dedicated making success .
determine actualy traveled kenya make change .
helped soothed people .
financaly emotionaly .
everyone poverty would word .
every person helped would better life .
one last reason made good progress year kenya .
kid could go school .

first reason kenya proverty country proverty .
many country 50 state took four year kenya country recover .
50 time four two-hundred take really long .
second reason many people need help donõt much time state country people living long gone .
little late .
even hannah thought kenya bad envirment .
third reason people going raise enough money 50 state lot country one state .
take really long time place raised money save country proverty .
fourth reason people keep saving money country become proverty proverty going long time say going ever .
proverty hard prevent happening every country country .
fifth reason hard right think might happen afterward .
proverty make thing hard people live example kenya earn $ 1 day canõt find money themselve plus child .
five reason proverty might still going even turn 70 .

òthe people sauri made amazing progress four yearsó since 2004-2008 .
hope people sauri better year .
child sauri able go school school supply achieved .
someday everony world wonõt poverty .
òmaking changeó think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity òfund raiseró kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back itõs foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenyaõs poverty , think itõs unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money donõt want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country arenõt poorest country .
theyõre alot better everything .
yes .
think yes life like nwo sauri could imagine itõs like future .
could also determine future village .
enough thing need finished sauri finished four year would probably able different village .
author convince winning fight proverty life time acheivement .
think even give food water fertilizer every thing still going run eventually .
going need stuff .
eventually going able sleves .
also need teacher doctor .
people wnat become teacher doctor educated .
unpaved dirt road made car jump traveld millennium village sauri kenya .
reached village , walked bar sauri primary school meet people .
welcoming music singing almost everyone dancing .
year 2004 , first time ever sauri .
help millennium village project , place would change dramatically coming year .
millennium village project created help reach millennium development goal .
plan get people poverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quaility life community .
know story community childrens help learn , kid go school get high grade , chore parent .
thatõs kid something good important .
family homeless .
parent need take care kid donõt find food water kid become sick .
kid sauri attend school parent afford school fee .
kid needed help chore , fetching water wood .
author convince winning fight againts poverty achevable lifetime
2004 , poverty taking sauri
four year later electricity , running water , medicens put hospital , parent longer pay child go school also eat lunch .
also bed net every bed 80 village mosquito carry malaria n't bite people make sick .
2004 sauri n't good .
hospital small electricity , running water , ran clinical officer .
malaria killed 20,000 kid day made adult qick .
buy bed ned $ 5 people poor , could afford later get sick .
people sauri would farmer lot crop would die dont fertilizer , farmer dont food family family would hungry child would sick starvation .
people american n't go ,
people city , state , even country around would go poverty people around world doesnt even know
team could probably fight poverty get away good .
stuck poverty would want help people .
come together help like people helped villager sauri , africa .
yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wonõt die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
possidle stop poverty complety .
one example people getting born ever se mean ther le fod upoming people mean provety might increase .
second example economy money wasted war easily .
third reason help countrises countrises might get atteck lose money strat help .
fourth reason limtet stuff could give since preety broke .
winning provety acheivable lifetime money sometime something everyone need money something waste , use wisely .
many state , country , continent city poor .
somehow think place called kenya poor place told child mother back , running around tattered clothes tattered mean riped torned apart .
kinda like lifetime many homeless people sitting street .
also like city , san francisco , lottery place many adult teenager go lottery ticket might win lottery ticket .
achievable fighting provety also good thing place like lottery place help .
also person help mostly money saving company .
agree winning provety achievable lifetime many provety , people known poor people government priesdent help achieve goal term .
serious problem author persuaded think helping africa think helping millenium villageõs project .
africa populated people need help care , something donõt .
malaria common disease africa causeing people depressing life .
example , people sleep chemicalized bed net .
also , work outside , probably causing get malaria , get money use health supply .
impoverished another main problem africa .
poverty causing child miss education need become better .
farmer grow crop need eat , survive .
africa trouble becoming sick impoverished .
millenium village project may help , might enough .
thse serious problem , well fighting better health .
life improved work hard study hard pacient three thing sec life .
also wait keep winning stand self stand others .
one thing never something thats leagle never steal stuff get trouble .
think winning fight aganist poverty achievable lifetime help 1,000 people sauri kenya .
plan get people proverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
give better clothing ragged clothing wear every single day .
passage paragraph 9 state sauri kenya people better life connected water line hostipal even electricity light .

kid die easily , adult get sick .
bed net , treated chemical last five year , keep malarial mosquito away sleeping people .
net cost $ 5 .
cheap people lived poor .
teamwork , care , believe , money .
know isnõt going easy task say achieve .
intro first reason important to/for kid know kenya when/as get older helpout kenya lot material & resource donõt .
another reason important to/for kid know kenya
time/at present time maybe look back history & see poor food/no $ maybe learn lesson
like said , advanced & better & qualified material , day kid & adult spoiled , phone store , house & even shoe clothes
dont ,
since go nice thing lot money & donõt even think giving $ kenya donate help country
need .
2004 know 2004 country called kenya country south africa , poor & impoverished place .
millenium many problem ex : farmer crop died didnt $ , people died hunger parent couldnt afford school fee , & school midday meal ( lunch ) school supply .
child still determined learn & get good education .
another thing patient went hospital , doctor , water/electricity , top child & adult share bed .
( 2-3 kid one bed , & $ one drame .
also 2004 disease called malaria , disease person betten mosquito .
good thing preventable , people bed net cover bed insect could get many people one .
country terrible .
2008 2008 4 year later /sauri /had changed year , people didnõt pay school fee farmer fertilizer & seed grow crop , generator hospital used to/for electricity .
hospital medicine , school serve meal & attendance school .
important kid didnõt go school wouldnt good education/they wouldnõt learn anything .
didnõt education get older wouldnt job .
conclusion seem yr many people & place gotten better & progressed thatõs good how/what happed .
millenium bad time still made .
many people dud millenium country better , still need help bit because/until country good .

would take lot people world improve poor country .
plus text say 20,000 kid die day .
count year even month would lot kid .
even though said people sauri made amazing progress .
still think couldnõt heal provide food every single people .
many village africa havenõt gone .

bet everyone every part africa suffering .
take money support oter country .

yes , author convinced winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
text say plan get people poverty assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply .
goal supposed met 2015 , target set 2025.we halfway 2015 , world capable meeting goal .
think poverty eliminated generationõs lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri didnõt simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u werenõt avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people couldnõt afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri didnõt go school .
found werenõt enough thing book pencil .
majority student didnõt eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
believe òwinning fight povertyó achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine isnõt high people able donate reasonal amount money help peopleõs life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wonõt grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , wouldnõt live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri donõt hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also didnõt midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
donõt get privilages , believe change .
yes author convinced fight proverty achievable already started .
know achievable already started helping hospital , school , crop .
helped problem mosketoes made medicine got infection made bed net people dont get disease .
anothe way kid dont amout money sent thier child school sent school
didnt food
end day child dont right amount energy need
payed food give .
people even gae furtalizer people village .
even though done much every body !
together .
purpose paper identify based article author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say yes put part like work together help sauri , keny trust believe change poorness able better education way better doctor hospital .
say text said hospital n't water electrisity .
past year work make better water electrisity keep working keep working make even better .
chance change poorness would kid way better future better education .
reason say reading artical made think fair like alot thing still think enough kid nothing compare .
chance go help would , would anything thats possible help kid get better education help get clos shoe .
( back question ) yes think author story support point view see people made big differances life .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think author think imortant kid learn keya sould happy maidsend & sand & changed .
kenya , 20,000 kid die every day , cure also , people fell sad & ill .
inset pay 5 $ sud save line .
kenya cure lot people die fron doctor heple work togeter fix
author convince fight poverty 2008 hospital medicine fight disease , also water connected hospital , generator electricity .
school started supply student , lunch , school fee , attendance rate .
example something seems hard impossible never let go fail fall , canõt give got get keep trying till suceed .
village millennium thought compliting goal going hard accomplish .
noticed tried hardest work together could accomplish impossible stuff could turn possible stuff .
kenya could accomplish something seemed impossible canõt something challenging ?
yes , agree author life millennium village sauri kenya improved
author article hannah sachs actually went kenya saw poverty like enough money bed net people kenya started getting malaria improvment shown like bed net medicine
sauri , kenya improved .
believe sauri improved like fertilizer irrigation also medicine yala sub-district hospital .
shown load improvement attendence school .
òit gone way upó like author say .
disagree author òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó point hardly money .
economy low .
thousand thousand poverty always .
doesnõt seem logic realistic one day would poverty .
many thing need improvement make little improvement make big difference .
donõt see fight poverty achievable point world .
agree author sauri place shown improvement keep showing improvement everyone help .
know isnõt going happen different type people donõt even care going care money .
never change .
conclusion believe since economy bad alot selfish people donõt want help number poverty .
believe fight poverty occur .
show little improvement make big difference hope one day poverty .
donõt think goal need date 2015 .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
itõs mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri didnõt even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply donõt money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet itõs affecting people donõt five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food itõs impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed cropsõ growth farmer also donõt extra money .
winning poverty isnõt impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime isnõt enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
òhelp comingó author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference todayõs society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor canõt afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid donõt really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid donõt much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food donõt buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people donõt enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people canõt afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wonõt share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .
article convince .

2 ) chidren got school could pay stay help his/her parent .

3 ) farmer didnõt money keep crop alive many people could get food .
example # 1-3 1 ) hospital medicine free genorator keep hospital powered .
everywhere sleeping place bed net .
2 ) child go school .

average person life 75-80 .
enough time .
thirdly , donõt know enough people willing go help .
family would , need thousand , mabey even hundred thousand family help .
donõt think enough people would get lazy butt go help people like sauri .
author say òwe travel town bumpy road village sauri.ó , could mean two people several people .
donõt think enough people volunteer .
youõve heard opinion resource , time , people power .

winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
think win poverty ?
people think totally possible , others think much poverty .
6 billion people world 50 % live $ 2.50 le day .
think many people get everyone poverty .
lot people .
around 6 billion people worldwide 2.2 billion kid .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 per day .
much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
donõt think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor personõs life .
definately change peopleõs life , everybodyõs .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
canõt conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference peopleõs life .
canõt get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , donõt enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyoneõs life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people donõt know people money .
even though canõt change world , take step change life .
, text state , ò20,000 kid die disease day.ó another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .
also medicine hospital free , supplied farmer water fertilizer , tool farm plant !
improved 80 village , think might make lifetime , could get money buy food trade country !
yes

runing water electricity hospital .
author convinced winning fight aganst poverty achievable lifetime .
author convinced winning fight poverty possible lifetime 80 village already making progress .
think many village help impoverished .
also sauri made lot progress already , village helped .
another example people sauri made lot progress four year , prof place africa helped .
farmer sauri already fertilizer irrigation enough food crop feed family .
people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .
kid think better lunch .
another reason lot people suffer disease prevented .
world provide medicine treat disease .
would say author convince òwinning fight poverty achievable , lifetime
think try succeed , mean people start donating thing like food , beverage , clean , uncontaminated water , clothing , medecines , money , shelter , hospit .
child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
important dirty water sicken kill people , fertilizer slow well quickly crop grows .
bet day people n't get fed .
help , take year fix .
example kenya n't enough fertilizer .
yes , convinced much work thru life time took goal young age acomplishing .
also know wanted/wants putting heart mind get sprout .
reason convinced kid .
mostly impoverished land people live , grow crop food/vegetation .
well kid live happily .
also convinced quote òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetime.ó reason convinced
throw lifetime got something make sprout turn tree everytime something good tree give fruit eat
wont starve .
also , enjoys best helping people need donõt anything eat sometimes , donõt education .
might even food roof live always walking around naked barefoot around street .
mostly million people donõt know dieing hunger , dieseases , coldness , maybe even love donõt parents/family .
well food clothes shelter , people grateful anything possibly get .
really convinced talk help people donõt care say donõt time even thow really .

believe 70 proverty still going .
answer proverty beaten iõm 70 take really long time .
first reason kenya proverty country proverty .
many country 50 state took four year kenya country recover .
50 time four two-hundred take really long .
second reason many people need help donõt much time state country people living long gone .
little late .
even hannah thought kenya bad envirment .
third reason people going raise enough money 50 state lot country one state .
take really long time place raised money save country proverty .
fourth reason people keep saving money country become proverty proverty going long time say going ever .
proverty hard prevent happening every country country .
fifth reason hard right think might happen afterward .
proverty make thing hard people live example kenya earn $ 1 day canõt find money themselve plus child .
five reason proverty might still going even turn 70 .
donõt believe prediction iõm wrong believe world better place live ever .

òthe people sauri made amazing progress four yearsó since 2004-2008 .
hope people sauri better year .
child sauri able go school school supply achieved .
someday everony world wonõt poverty .
òmaking changeó think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity òfund raiseró kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back itõs foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenyaõs poverty , think itõs unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money donõt want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country arenõt poorest country .
theyõre alot better everything .
yes .
think yes life like nwo sauri could imagine itõs like future .
could also determine future village .
enough thing need finished sauri finished four year would probably able different village .
author convince winning fight proverty life time acheivement .
think even give food water fertilizer every thing still going run eventually .
going need stuff .
eventually going able sleves .
also need teacher doctor .
people wnat become teacher doctor educated .
unpaved dirt road made car jump traveld millennium village sauri kenya .
reached village , walked bar sauri primary school meet people .
welcoming music singing almost everyone dancing .
year 2004 , first time ever sauri .
help millennium village project , place would change dramatically coming year .
millennium village project created help reach millennium development goal .
plan get people poverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quaility life community .
know story community childrens help learn , kid go school get high grade , chore parent .
thatõs kid something good important .
family homeless .
parent need take care kid donõt find food water kid become sick .
kid sauri attend school parent afford school fee .
kid needed help chore , fetching water wood .
author convince winning fight againts poverty achevable lifetime
2004 , poverty taking sauri
four year later electricity , running water , medicens put hospital , parent longer pay child go school also eat lunch .
also bed net every bed 80 village mosquito carry malaria n't bite people make sick .
2004 sauri n't good .
hospital small electricity , running water , ran clinical officer .
malaria killed 20,000 kid day made adult qick .
buy bed ned $ 5 people poor , could afford later get sick .
people sauri would farmer lot crop would die dont fertilizer , farmer dont food family family would hungry child would sick starvation .
people american n't go ,
people city , state , even country around would go poverty people around world doesnt even know
team could probably fight poverty get away good .
stuck poverty would want help people .
come together help like people helped villager sauri , africa .
yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wonõt die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
possidle stop poverty complety .
one example people getting born ever se mean ther le fod upoming people mean provety might increase .
second example economy money wasted war easily .
third reason help countrises countrises might get atteck lose money strat help .
fourth reason limtet stuff could give since preety broke .
winning provety acheivable lifetime money sometime something everyone need money something waste , use wisely .
many state , country , continent city poor .
somehow think place called kenya poor place told child mother back , running around tattered clothes tattered mean riped torned apart .
kinda like lifetime many homeless people sitting street .
also like city , san francisco , lottery place many adult teenager go lottery ticket might win lottery ticket .
achievable fighting provety also good thing place like lottery place help .
also person help mostly money saving company .
agree winning provety achievable lifetime many provety , people known poor people government priesdent help achieve goal term .
serious problem author persuaded think helping africa think helping millenium villageõs project .
africa populated people need help care , something donõt .
malaria common disease africa causeing people depressing life .
example , people sleep chemicalized bed net .
also , work outside , probably causing get malaria , get money use health supply .
impoverished another main problem africa .
poverty causing child miss education need become better .
farmer grow crop need eat , survive .
africa trouble becoming sick impoverished .
millenium village project may help , might enough .
thse serious problem , well fighting better health .
life improved work hard study hard pacient three thing sec life .
also wait keep winning stand self stand others .
one thing never something thats leagle never steal stuff get trouble .
think winning fight aganist poverty achievable lifetime help 1,000 people sauri kenya .
plan get people proverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
give better clothing ragged clothing wear every single day .
passage paragraph 9 state sauri kenya people better life connected water line hostipal even electricity light .

know isnõt going easy task say achieve .
intro first reason important to/for kid know kenya when/as get older helpout kenya lot material & resource donõt .
another reason important to/for kid know kenya
time/at present time maybe look back history & see poor food/no $ maybe learn lesson
like said , advanced & better & qualified material , day kid & adult spoiled , phone store , house & even shoe clothes
dont ,
since go nice thing lot money & donõt even think giving $ kenya donate help country
need .
2004 know 2004 country called kenya country south africa , poor & impoverished place .
millenium many problem ex : farmer crop died didnt $ , people died hunger parent couldnt afford school fee , & school midday meal ( lunch ) school supply .
child still determined learn & get good education .
another thing patient went hospital , doctor , water/electricity , top child & adult share bed .
( 2-3 kid one bed , & $ one drame .
also 2004 disease called malaria , disease person betten mosquito .
good thing preventable , people bed net cover bed insect could get many people one .
country terrible .
2008 2008 4 year later /sauri /had changed year , people didnõt pay school fee farmer fertilizer & seed grow crop , generator hospital used to/for electricity .
hospital medicine , school serve meal & attendance school .
important kid didnõt go school wouldnt good education/they wouldnõt learn anything .
didnõt education get older wouldnt job .
conclusion seem yr many people & place gotten better & progressed thatõs good how/what happed .
millenium bad time still made .
many people dud millenium country better , still need help bit because/until country good .

village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply .
goal supposed met 2015 , target set 2025.we halfway 2015 , world capable meeting goal .
think poverty eliminated generationõs lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri didnõt simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u werenõt avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people couldnõt afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri didnõt go school .
found werenõt enough thing book pencil .
majority student didnõt eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
believe òwinning fight povertyó achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine isnõt high people able donate reasonal amount money help peopleõs life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wonõt grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , wouldnõt live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri donõt hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also didnõt midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
donõt get privilages , believe change .
yes author convinced fight proverty achievable already started .
know achievable already started helping hospital , school , crop .
helped problem mosketoes made medicine got infection made bed net people dont get disease .
anothe way kid dont amout money sent thier child school sent school
didnt food
end day child dont right amount energy need
payed food give .
people even gae furtalizer people village .
even though done much every body !
together .
purpose paper identify based article author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say yes put part like work together help sauri , keny trust believe change poorness able better education way better doctor hospital .
say text said hospital n't water electrisity .
past year work make better water electrisity keep working keep working make even better .
chance change poorness would kid way better future better education .
reason say reading artical made think fair like alot thing still think enough kid nothing compare .
chance go help would , would anything thats possible help kid get better education help get clos shoe .
( back question ) yes think author story support point view see people made big differances life .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think author think imortant kid learn keya sould happy maidsend & sand & changed .
kenya , 20,000 kid die every day , cure also , people fell sad & ill .
inset pay 5 $ sud save line .
kenya cure lot people die fron doctor heple work togeter fix
author convince fight poverty 2008 hospital medicine fight disease , also water connected hospital , generator electricity .
school started supply student , lunch , school fee , attendance rate .
example something seems hard impossible never let go fail fall , canõt give got get keep trying till suceed .
village millennium thought compliting goal going hard accomplish .
noticed tried hardest work together could accomplish impossible stuff could turn possible stuff .
kenya could accomplish something seemed impossible canõt something challenging ?
yes , agree author life millennium village sauri kenya improved
author article hannah sachs actually went kenya saw poverty like enough money bed net people kenya started getting malaria improvment shown like bed net medicine
sauri , kenya improved .
believe sauri improved like fertilizer irrigation also medicine yala sub-district hospital .
shown load improvement attendence school .
òit gone way upó like author say .
disagree author òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó point hardly money .
economy low .
thousand thousand poverty always .
doesnõt seem logic realistic one day would poverty .
many thing need improvement make little improvement make big difference .
donõt see fight poverty achievable point world .
agree author sauri place shown improvement keep showing improvement everyone help .
know isnõt going happen different type people donõt even care going care money .
never change .
conclusion believe since economy bad alot selfish people donõt want help number poverty .
believe fight poverty occur .
show little improvement make big difference hope one day poverty .
donõt think goal need date 2015 .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
itõs mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri didnõt even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply donõt money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet itõs affecting people donõt five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food itõs impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed cropsõ growth farmer also donõt extra money .
winning poverty isnõt impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime isnõt enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
òhelp comingó author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference todayõs society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor canõt afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid donõt really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid donõt much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food donõt buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people donõt enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people canõt afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wonõt share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .
article convince .

itõs make sauri better place .
even though take time make improved young age braveness making better .

hannah right .
agree artical saying whe could change poverty .
could give money working hard .
family could start working .

2 ) chidren got school could pay stay help his/her parent .
energy got home couldnõt get lunch school .
3 ) farmer didnõt money keep crop alive many people could get food .
example # 1-3 1 ) hospital medicine free genorator keep hospital powered .
everywhere sleeping place bed net .
2 ) child go school .
lunch school fee .
3 ) farmer money care crop hunger crisis preety much .

parent could afford school kid millennium village project kid donõt pay book pencil .
midday meal .
believe òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó note people world suari , kenya donõt much , , school earn education .
school fee high cost family poverity money .
also , school child didnõt enough book , pencil , paper .
since child didnõt go school expected help chore house , get firewood , farm , many chore .
many people didnõt lunch , lead low energy = sick .
sick hospital provided medincine free yet medicine common disease like malaria caused mosquitoesõ bite .
kenya bed net helped prevented bite .
therefore , fact family poor , without much education , frequently sick/ill conclude end mellenium village project support reduce struggle people sauri , kenya .

1st didnst good clothes wearing tattered clothes .
tattered mean torn ragged .
say want proverty .
know mean poor littel money .
project goal sit 2015 .
time 2025 .
example doctor , water electricity .
medican , enogh bed hospital 3 kid go 1 bed , 2 adult go another bed together .
today medacan , electricity , running clean water even bed net .
bednets net put tent sleeping mosquito canõt bite sleep give malaria .
thatõs everyday 20,000 kid bie malaria .
think know kenya respect appreceationate ready usa .
thatõs kenya people nothing still donõt .
one rich contrys earth , car , try help , know kenya .
tell truth even know kenya exzied may 21 , 2010 .
mother lose kid everyday kenya .
unisted state mother lose mind kid .

think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetime.ó believe ti many people trying help situation already .
probably way upcoming year come .
couple year ago healthcare big issue .
adult child suffering disease easy prevent , like malaria .
way prevent buying bed net .
one cost 5 dollar , living le one dollar day couldnõt afford .
every sleeping site sauri bed net malaria prevented .
another issue occured past lack fertilizer water crop .
farm sauri crop dying farmer couldnõt afford neccesary fertilizer crop .
farmer always worry child think wonõt able feed entire family , happens every year .
also child couldnõt attend school parent couldnõt afford .
child usually chore couldnt learn .
child could attend school wasnt better .
school lacking school supply like pencil paper .
tool planting food afford fertilizer .
school better school fee anymore .

three kides abed .
also two adult bed .
rom packed patient probably would recive treatment , either hospital patient could afford .
doctor , clinical office running preventable disease people whoa near death shouldnõt .
running water electricity .

ending proverty stop people suffering day continue .
sauri , kenya , villager get $ 1 day buy little food need .
sick people share bed leading people get infected easily .
child try learn little supply , donõt eat providing energy body .
hospital limited amount medicine .
much plant grow dessert thereõs water .
proverty actually ruin many life .
winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
think win poverty ?
people think totally possible , others think much poverty .
6 billion people world 50 % live $ 2.50 le day .
think many people get everyone poverty .
lot people .
around 6 billion people worldwide 2.2 billion kid .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 per day .
much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
donõt think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor personõs life .
definately change peopleõs life , everybodyõs .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
canõt conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference peopleõs life .
canõt get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , donõt enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyoneõs life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people donõt know people money .
even though canõt change world , take step change life .
, text state , ò20,000 kid die disease day.ó another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .
also medicine hospital free , supplied farmer water fertilizer , tool farm plant !
improved 80 village , think might make lifetime , could get money buy food trade country !
yes

runing water electricity hospital .
author convinced winning fight aganst poverty achievable lifetime .
author convinced winning fight poverty possible lifetime 80 village already making progress .
think many village help impoverished .
also sauri made lot progress already , village helped .
another example people sauri made lot progress four year , prof place africa helped .
farmer sauri already fertilizer irrigation enough food crop feed family .
people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .
kid think better lunch .
another reason lot people suffer disease prevented .
world provide medicine treat disease .
would say author convince òwinning fight poverty achievable , lifetime
think try succeed , mean people start donating thing like food , beverage , clean , uncontaminated water , clothing , medecines , money , shelter , hospit .
child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
important dirty water sicken kill people , fertilizer slow well quickly crop grows .
bet day people n't get fed .
help , take year fix .
example kenya n't enough fertilizer .
yes , convinced much work thru life time took goal young age acomplishing .
also know wanted/wants putting heart mind get sprout .
reason convinced kid .

òthe people sauri made amazing progress four yearsó since 2004-2008 .
hope people sauri better year .
child sauri able go school school supply achieved .
someday everony world wonõt poverty .
òmaking changeó think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity òfund raiseró kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back itõs foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenyaõs poverty , think itõs unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money donõt want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country arenõt poorest country .
theyõre alot better everything .
yes .
think yes life like nwo sauri could imagine itõs like future .
could also determine future village .
enough thing need finished sauri finished four year would probably able different village .
author convince winning fight proverty life time acheivement .
think even give food water fertilizer every thing still going run eventually .
going need stuff .
eventually going able sleves .
also need teacher doctor .
people wnat become teacher doctor educated .
unpaved dirt road made car jump traveld millennium village sauri kenya .
reached village , walked bar sauri primary school meet people .
welcoming music singing almost everyone dancing .
year 2004 , first time ever sauri .
help millennium village project , place would change dramatically coming year .
millennium village project created help reach millennium development goal .
plan get people poverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quaility life community .
know story community childrens help learn , kid go school get high grade , chore parent .
thatõs kid something good important .
family homeless .
parent need take care kid donõt find food water kid become sick .
kid sauri attend school parent afford school fee .
kid needed help chore , fetching water wood .
author convince winning fight againts poverty achevable lifetime
2004 , poverty taking sauri
four year later electricity , running water , medicens put hospital , parent longer pay child go school also eat lunch .
also bed net every bed 80 village mosquito carry malaria n't bite people make sick .
2004 sauri n't good .
hospital small electricity , running water , ran clinical officer .
malaria killed 20,000 kid day made adult qick .
buy bed ned $ 5 people poor , could afford later get sick .
people sauri would farmer lot crop would die dont fertilizer , farmer dont food family family would hungry child would sick starvation .
people american n't go ,
people city , state , even country around would go poverty people around world doesnt even know
team could probably fight poverty get away good .
stuck poverty would want help people .
come together help like people helped villager sauri , africa .
yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wonõt die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
possidle stop poverty complety .
one example people getting born ever se mean ther le fod upoming people mean provety might increase .
second example economy money wasted war easily .
third reason help countrises countrises might get atteck lose money strat help .
fourth reason limtet stuff could give since preety broke .
winning provety acheivable lifetime money sometime something everyone need money something waste , use wisely .
many state , country , continent city poor .
somehow think place called kenya poor place told child mother back , running around tattered clothes tattered mean riped torned apart .
kinda like lifetime many homeless people sitting street .
also like city , san francisco , lottery place many adult teenager go lottery ticket might win lottery ticket .
achievable fighting provety also good thing place like lottery place help .
also person help mostly money saving company .
agree winning provety achievable lifetime many provety , people known poor people government priesdent help achieve goal term .
serious problem author persuaded think helping africa think helping millenium villageõs project .
africa populated people need help care , something donõt .
malaria common disease africa causeing people depressing life .
example , people sleep chemicalized bed net .
also , work outside , probably causing get malaria , get money use health supply .
impoverished another main problem africa .
poverty causing child miss education need become better .
farmer grow crop need eat , survive .
africa trouble becoming sick impoverished .
millenium village project may help , might enough .
thse serious problem , well fighting better health .
life improved work hard study hard pacient three thing sec life .
also wait keep winning stand self stand others .
one thing never something thats leagle never steal stuff get trouble .
think winning fight aganist poverty achievable lifetime help 1,000 people sauri kenya .

intro first reason important to/for kid know kenya when/as get older helpout kenya lot material & resource donõt .
another reason important to/for kid know kenya
time/at present time maybe look back history & see poor food/no $ maybe learn lesson
like said , advanced & better & qualified material , day kid & adult spoiled , phone store , house & even shoe clothes
dont ,
since go nice thing lot money & donõt even think giving $ kenya donate help country
need .
2004 know 2004 country called kenya country south africa , poor & impoverished place .
millenium many problem ex : farmer crop died didnt $ , people died hunger parent couldnt afford school fee , & school midday meal ( lunch ) school supply .
child still determined learn & get good education .
another thing patient went hospital , doctor , water/electricity , top child & adult share bed .
( 2-3 kid one bed , & $ one drame .
also 2004 disease called malaria , disease person betten mosquito .
good thing preventable , people bed net cover bed insect could get many people one .
country terrible .
2008 2008 4 year later /sauri /had changed year , people didnõt pay school fee farmer fertilizer & seed grow crop , generator hospital used to/for electricity .
hospital medicine , school serve meal & attendance school .
important kid didnõt go school wouldnt good education/they wouldnõt learn anything .
didnõt education get older wouldnt job .

millenium bad time still made .
many people dud millenium country better , still need help bit because/until country good .

people selfish , acutally believe could actually fight poverty , fact one selfish .
example text say òthe room packed patient probably would receive treatment , either
hospital patient could afford it.ó qoute show selfish people actually
always help people rich .
even selfish , donõt think possible win fight poverty .
people think could actully win fight poverty technology getting better better , disgreed even technology getting better dosenõt mean people change .
people smart .
know good .
eventually people gon na get smarter smarter time go .
esample text said òthe people made amazing progress four year , water connected hospital , also generator electricity.ó text show people getting smarter .

village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply .
goal supposed met 2015 , target set 2025.we halfway 2015 , world capable meeting goal .
think poverty eliminated generationõs lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri didnõt simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u werenõt avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people couldnõt afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri didnõt go school .
found werenõt enough thing book pencil .
majority student didnõt eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
believe òwinning fight povertyó achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine isnõt high people able donate reasonal amount money help peopleõs life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wonõt grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , wouldnõt live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri donõt hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also didnõt midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
donõt get privilages , believe change .
yes author convinced fight proverty achievable already started .
know achievable already started helping hospital , school , crop .
helped problem mosketoes made medicine got infection made bed net people dont get disease .
anothe way kid dont amout money sent thier child school sent school
didnt food
end day child dont right amount energy need
payed food give .
people even gae furtalizer people village .
even though done much every body !
together .
purpose paper identify based article author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say yes put part like work together help sauri , keny trust believe change poorness able better education way better doctor hospital .
say text said hospital n't water electrisity .
past year work make better water electrisity keep working keep working make even better .
chance change poorness would kid way better future better education .
reason say reading artical made think fair like alot thing still think enough kid nothing compare .
chance go help would , would anything thats possible help kid get better education help get clos shoe .
( back question ) yes think author story support point view see people made big differances life .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think author think imortant kid learn keya sould happy maidsend & sand & changed .
kenya , 20,000 kid die every day , cure also , people fell sad & ill .
inset pay 5 $ sud save line .
kenya cure lot people die fron doctor heple work togeter fix
author convince fight poverty 2008 hospital medicine fight disease , also water connected hospital , generator electricity .
school started supply student , lunch , school fee , attendance rate .
example something seems hard impossible never let go fail fall , canõt give got get keep trying till suceed .
village millennium thought compliting goal going hard accomplish .
noticed tried hardest work together could accomplish impossible stuff could turn possible stuff .
kenya could accomplish something seemed impossible canõt something challenging ?
yes , agree author life millennium village sauri kenya improved
author article hannah sachs actually went kenya saw poverty like enough money bed net people kenya started getting malaria improvment shown like bed net medicine
sauri , kenya improved .
believe sauri improved like fertilizer irrigation also medicine yala sub-district hospital .
shown load improvement attendence school .
òit gone way upó like author say .
disagree author òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó point hardly money .
economy low .
thousand thousand poverty always .
doesnõt seem logic realistic one day would poverty .
many thing need improvement make little improvement make big difference .
donõt see fight poverty achievable point world .
agree author sauri place shown improvement keep showing improvement everyone help .
know isnõt going happen different type people donõt even care going care money .
never change .
conclusion believe since economy bad alot selfish people donõt want help number poverty .
believe fight poverty occur .
show little improvement make big difference hope one day poverty .
donõt think goal need date 2015 .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
itõs mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri didnõt even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply donõt money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet itõs affecting people donõt five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food itõs impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed cropsõ growth farmer also donõt extra money .
winning poverty isnõt impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime isnõt enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
òhelp comingó author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference todayõs society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor canõt afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid donõt really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid donõt much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food donõt buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people donõt enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people canõt afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wonõt share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .

2 ) chidren got school could pay stay help his/her parent .

3 ) farmer didnõt money keep crop alive many people could get food .
example # 1-3 1 ) hospital medicine free genorator keep hospital powered .
everywhere sleeping place bed net .
2 ) child go school .

winning fight poverty achievable lifetime ?
think win poverty ?
people think totally possible , others think much poverty .
6 billion people world 50 % live $ 2.50 le day .
think many people get everyone poverty .
lot people .
around 6 billion people worldwide 2.2 billion kid .
1.2 billion people live le $ 1 per day .
much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
donõt think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor personõs life .
definately change peopleõs life , everybodyõs .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
canõt conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference peopleõs life .
canõt get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , donõt enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyoneõs life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people donõt know people money .
even though canõt change world , take step change life .
, text state , ò20,000 kid die disease day.ó another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .
also medicine hospital free , supplied farmer water fertilizer , tool farm plant !
improved 80 village , think might make lifetime , could get money buy food trade country !
yes

author convinced winning fight aganst poverty achievable lifetime .
author convinced winning fight poverty possible lifetime 80 village already making progress .
think many village help impoverished .
also sauri made lot progress already , village helped .
another example people sauri made lot progress four year , prof place africa helped .
farmer sauri already fertilizer irrigation enough food crop feed family .
people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .
kid think better lunch .
another reason lot people suffer disease prevented .
world provide medicine treat disease .
would say author convince òwinning fight poverty achievable , lifetime
think try succeed , mean people start donating thing like food , beverage , clean , uncontaminated water , clothing , medecines , money , shelter , hospit .
child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
important dirty water sicken kill people , fertilizer slow well quickly crop grows .
bet day people n't get fed .
help , take year fix .
example kenya n't enough fertilizer .
yes , convinced much work thru life time took goal young age acomplishing .
also know wanted/wants putting heart mind get sprout .
reason convinced kid .
mostly impoverished land people live , grow crop food/vegetation .
well kid live happily .
also convinced quote òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetime.ó reason convinced
throw lifetime got something make sprout turn tree everytime something good tree give fruit eat

also , enjoys best helping people need donõt anything eat sometimes , donõt education .
might even food roof live always walking around naked barefoot around street .
mostly million people donõt know dieing hunger , dieseases , coldness , maybe even love donõt parents/family .
well food clothes shelter , people grateful anything possibly get .
really convinced talk help people donõt care say donõt time even thow really .

believe millenium village project could greatly improve current condition place like sauri .
one idea found helpful , fight better health .

program give people village three important thing .
first two , water fertilizer , help villager grow crop feed make money .
third part , knowledge , improve educational system child learn .
believe millenium village project make world better place .

, however , vast majority people world living poverty .
seems impossible , let tell , .
hannah sachs family able help oversee change country africa .
sauri , kenya millenium village project took place story .

people couldnõt even eat due lack fertilizer .
course 4 year , thing changed better .
hard work dedication really pay .

òthe people sauri made amazing progress four yearsó since 2004-2008 .
hope people sauri better year .
child sauri able go school school supply achieved .
someday everony world wonõt poverty .
òmaking changeó think kenya need help different wealthy country u.s , china , possibly england .
country example , even though kenya lot better , united nation would like keep strong .
one reason think many country participating activity òfund raiseró kenya wealthy .
people kenya barely holding onto little bit .
order another country back itõs foot strong need contribute giving nice crop clothing .
maybe even school teacher .
personal opinion kenyaõs poverty , think itõs unexceptable state , province , country others around world today , always talking money donõt want share .
thinking back millennium village project first starting worldwide .
make wonder , ?
millennium village project took big task save poor country losing hope normal life satisfaction sucess .
kenya used poor country medicine cure everyday disease .
look kenya , nice lower-middle class society school free , crop actually eatable .
kenya come long way poverty depression .
kenya recieving help country arenõt poorest country .
theyõre alot better everything .
yes .
think yes life like nwo sauri could imagine itõs like future .
could also determine future village .
enough thing need finished sauri finished four year would probably able different village .
author convince winning fight proverty life time acheivement .
think even give food water fertilizer every thing still going run eventually .
going need stuff .
eventually going able sleves .
also need teacher doctor .
people wnat become teacher doctor educated .
unpaved dirt road made car jump traveld millennium village sauri kenya .
reached village , walked bar sauri primary school meet people .
welcoming music singing almost everyone dancing .
year 2004 , first time ever sauri .
help millennium village project , place would change dramatically coming year .
millennium village project created help reach millennium development goal .
plan get people poverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quaility life community .
know story community childrens help learn , kid go school get high grade , chore parent .
thatõs kid something good important .
family homeless .
parent need take care kid donõt find food water kid become sick .
kid sauri attend school parent afford school fee .
kid needed help chore , fetching water wood .
author convince winning fight againts poverty achevable lifetime
2004 , poverty taking sauri
four year later electricity , running water , medicens put hospital , parent longer pay child go school also eat lunch .
also bed net every bed 80 village mosquito carry malaria n't bite people make sick .
2004 sauri n't good .
hospital small electricity , running water , ran clinical officer .
malaria killed 20,000 kid day made adult qick .
buy bed ned $ 5 people poor , could afford later get sick .
people sauri would farmer lot crop would die dont fertilizer , farmer dont food family family would hungry child would sick starvation .
people american n't go ,
people city , state , even country around would go poverty people around world doesnt even know
team could probably fight poverty get away good .
stuck poverty would want help people .
come together help like people helped villager sauri , africa .
yes author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime
example story sauri kenya 's basicly talking ca n't really afford anything like fertilizer , water , electrity child go school .
lifetime afford kind stuff like example bed net bug ( mosquito ) n't bed .
think òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó .
think achievable 4 year hospital medicine , school free , farming equipment food .
hospital used limited medicine 3 kid bed 2 adult bed .
day adult 1 child adult bed .
hospital also provide medicine common disease child adult wonõt die .
school also changed .
used pay go school .
, school free provides lunch 8 year ago .
kid would come home little energy finish day .
one last reason farmer used plant seed , would crop little fertilizer water .
farmer would worry harvest enough crop ?
kid go hungry become sick ?
farmer survive harvest enough crop without worrying family would survive become sick .
considering dramatic change occurred 8 year sauri , think winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
believe ca n't fight poverty .
know 's kind mean , realize many country poverty ?
well 's technology today move area start .
richer area usually like worked extremely hard build nation .
poor usually mean representative/leader n't work hard enough help .
, hardly .
( offense ) well 's difference broke going hard time .
natural disaster happened course probably struggling country help would .
said kid dying mosquito .
find way fight .
know 're provably thinking ohh n't money , ?
well old day , barter/trade .
every area something plenty .
find area want give stuff need .
's simple strategy .
always give something back person gave something trade 're helping others .
give n't get anything back .
also said worried farming , water , food .
well work plan .
come crawling country money worked hard earn .
think need .
need fertilizer make , maybe go another place try barter whatever .
water probably easiest thing get n't even know 're even asking .
go body fresh water drink .
kid go school .
make school smaller amount kid barter little bit stuff .
life area plentiful something begin get known .
1849 gold rush california people started come try strike rich .
started trade gold natural resource including oil , water vegetation
( example ) would california go nevada say ohh give u money , 're going die without , nevada dy ,
make sure barter , kill one another take away hard-earned money .
possidle stop poverty complety .
one example people getting born ever se mean ther le fod upoming people mean provety might increase .
second example economy money wasted war easily .
third reason help countrises countrises might get atteck lose money strat help .
fourth reason limtet stuff could give since preety broke .
winning provety acheivable lifetime money sometime something everyone need money something waste , use wisely .
many state , country , continent city poor .
somehow think place called kenya poor place told child mother back , running around tattered clothes tattered mean riped torned apart .
kinda like lifetime many homeless people sitting street .
also like city , san francisco , lottery place many adult teenager go lottery ticket might win lottery ticket .
achievable fighting provety also good thing place like lottery place help .
also person help mostly money saving company .
agree winning provety achievable lifetime many provety , people known poor people government priesdent help achieve goal term .
serious problem author persuaded think helping africa think helping millenium villageõs project .
africa populated people need help care , something donõt .
malaria common disease africa causeing people depressing life .
example , people sleep chemicalized bed net .
also , work outside , probably causing get malaria , get money use health supply .
impoverished another main problem africa .
poverty causing child miss education need become better .
farmer grow crop need eat , survive .
africa trouble becoming sick impoverished .
millenium village project may help , might enough .
thse serious problem , well fighting better health .
life improved work hard study hard pacient three thing sec life .
also wait keep winning stand self stand others .
one thing never something thats leagle never steal stuff get trouble .
think winning fight aganist poverty achievable lifetime help 1,000 people sauri kenya .
plan get people proverty , assure access health care help stabilize economy quality life community .
give better clothing ragged clothing wear every single day .
passage paragraph 9 state sauri kenya people better life connected water line hostipal even electricity light .
get help geting 1 dollar day buy net wont get bitten night miquoetos carry disease called malria child wont get dieases killem even adult .
help farmer water fertilizer .

teamwork , care , believe , money .
know isnõt going easy task say achieve .
intro first reason important to/for kid know kenya when/as get older helpout kenya lot material & resource donõt .
another reason important to/for kid know kenya
time/at present time maybe look back history & see poor food/no $ maybe learn lesson
like said , advanced & better & qualified material , day kid & adult spoiled , phone store , house & even shoe clothes
dont ,
since go nice thing lot money & donõt even think giving $ kenya donate help country
need .
2004 know 2004 country called kenya country south africa , poor & impoverished place .
millenium many problem ex : farmer crop died didnt $ , people died hunger parent couldnt afford school fee , & school midday meal ( lunch ) school supply .
child still determined learn & get good education .
another thing patient went hospital , doctor , water/electricity , top child & adult share bed .
( 2-3 kid one bed , & $ one drame .
also 2004 disease called malaria , disease person betten mosquito .
good thing preventable , people bed net cover bed insect could get many people one .
country terrible .
2008 2008 4 year later /sauri /had changed year , people didnõt pay school fee farmer fertilizer & seed grow crop , generator hospital used to/for electricity .
hospital medicine , school serve meal & attendance school .
important kid didnõt go school wouldnt good education/they wouldnõt learn anything .
didnõt education get older wouldnt job .

millenium bad time still made .
many people dud millenium country better , still need help bit because/until country good .

hospital patient could afford it.ó qoute show selfish people actually
always help people rich .
even selfish , donõt think possible win fight poverty .
people think could actully win fight poverty technology getting better better , disgreed even technology getting better dosenõt mean people change .
people smart .

eventually people gon na get smarter smarter time go .
esample text said òthe people made amazing progress four year , water connected hospital , also generator electricity.ó text show people getting smarter .

count year even month would lot kid .
even though said people sauri made amazing progress .
still think couldnõt heal provide food every single people .
many village africa havenõt gone .
said òthey gone 80 village across sub-saharan africaó .

bet everyone every part africa suffering .
take money support oter country .

village get technical advice practical item , fertilizer , medicine school supply .
goal supposed met 2015 , target set 2025.we halfway 2015 , world capable meeting goal .
think poverty eliminated generationõs lifetime simple thing done help need .
millenium project people sauri didnõt simple thing could easily made life better .
thing like medicine could easily afforded u werenõt avalible .
misquito net cost five dollar something family could afford ; hospital crowded many people couldnõt afford basic medical treatment .
water electricity .
four short year hospital transformed medical center could found u .
people could get free treatment , medicine , people clean water could see doctor .
farming sauri hard .
without thing like fertilizer irrigation crop could easily die leave family without food .
people sauri struggle order eat .
millenium project gave farmer tool needed grow crop quality life vastly improved .
four year .
many child sauri didnõt go school .
found werenõt enough thing book pencil .
majority student didnõt eat midday meal therefore energy end day .
four year later number student increased .
recieve lunch enough school supply .
life people sauri vastly improved .
simple thing short amount time .
fighting poverty done giving need simple thing like medicine food .
place make great stride towards bettering life people quickly easily , ending poverty world could easily achieved lifetime .
author convinced fighting poverty acheivable lifetime .
text say first people money access health care school supply .
text also state people enough money bed net medecine fight malariah .
many hospital electricity enough bed .
end every person village bed net electricity also scools school supply .
explains author acheive purpose begining village nothing many supply .
believe òwinning fight povertyó achievable .
believe achievable cost medicine isnõt high people able donate reasonal amount money help peopleõs life .
bed net cost five dollar , people able donate amount reasonable amount .
five dollar save person dying malaria .
farmer family also hard time .
farmer live fear crop wonõt grow aford proper fertlizer irrigation .
without crop family suffer .
family could starve become sick , even worse die starvation .
proper fertilizer irrigation , wouldnõt live fear .
child also suffer .
unlike u , fortunatly school , child sauri donõt hget chance education .
dont get privlage education like u family aforde school fee .
school hardly afford supply well .
2004 , school little supply child still worked hard tried best concetrate .
school also didnõt midday meal , child low energy .
kid chore fetching water wood instead attending school .
people sauri suffering .
donõt get privilages , believe change .
yes author convinced fight proverty achievable already started .
know achievable already started helping hospital , school , crop .
helped problem mosketoes made medicine got infection made bed net people dont get disease .
anothe way kid dont amout money sent thier child school sent school
didnt food
end day child dont right amount energy need
payed food give .
people even gae furtalizer people village .
even though done much every body !
together .
purpose paper identify based article author convince winning fight poverty achievable lifetime .
say yes put part like work together help sauri , keny trust believe change poorness able better education way better doctor hospital .
say text said hospital n't water electrisity .
past year work make better water electrisity keep working keep working make even better .
chance change poorness would kid way better future better education .
reason say reading artical made think fair like alot thing still think enough kid nothing compare .
chance go help would , would anything thats possible help kid get better education help get clos shoe .
( back question ) yes think author story support point view see people made big differances life .
author convince win fight poverty lifetime .
one example beccause first went sauri , little kid running around bare foot ad tattered clothing .
show ca n't afford shoe better clothing , would probably take lot money buy showes clothes every single person .
also , farmer ' crop dying could afford necessary fertilizer irrigation .
problem solved gift fertilizer , seed , tool .
however , farmer still need way get water crop .
another flaw doctor , clinical officer running hospital .
although condition hospital gotten better , lot patient sick , 's one person tend everyone ?
would clinical officer choose tend first ?
think hospital could even better real doctor , one .
think author think imortant kid learn keya sould happy maidsend & sand & changed .
kenya , 20,000 kid die every day , cure also , people fell sad & ill .
inset pay 5 $ sud save line .
kenya cure lot people die fron doctor heple work togeter fix
author convince fight poverty 2008 hospital medicine fight disease , also water connected hospital , generator electricity .
school started supply student , lunch , school fee , attendance rate .
example something seems hard impossible never let go fail fall , canõt give got get keep trying till suceed .
village millennium thought compliting goal going hard accomplish .
noticed tried hardest work together could accomplish impossible stuff could turn possible stuff .
kenya could accomplish something seemed impossible canõt something challenging ?
yes , agree author life millennium village sauri kenya improved
author article hannah sachs actually went kenya saw poverty like enough money bed net people kenya started getting malaria improvment shown like bed net medicine
sauri , kenya improved .
believe sauri improved like fertilizer irrigation also medicine yala sub-district hospital .
shown load improvement attendence school .
òit gone way upó like author say .
disagree author òwinning fight poverty achievable lifetimeó point hardly money .
economy low .
thousand thousand poverty always .
doesnõt seem logic realistic one day would poverty .
many thing need improvement make little improvement make big difference .
donõt see fight poverty achievable point world .
agree author sauri place shown improvement keep showing improvement everyone help .
know isnõt going happen different type people donõt even care going care money .
never change .
conclusion believe since economy bad alot selfish people donõt want help number poverty .
believe fight poverty occur .
show little improvement make big difference hope one day poverty .
donõt think goal need date 2015 .
, think ending poverty achievable one lifetime .
africa big continent sauri alone took four year .
itõs mission impossible take time century going .
like sachs said text , sauri didnõt even water electricity command .
electricity might important water efficient .
hospital , water needed cleaning wound .
also another problem medicine lacking .
malaria serious disease , maybe america back sauri , people dying every single day .
easy cure malaria adult kid dying simply donõt money buy medicine .
disease something prevent yet itõs affecting people donõt five dollar buy bed net .
lack food also important cause death .
farmer trying grow crop produce food itõs impossible decent result crop constantly dying .
fertilizer constantly needed cropsõ growth farmer also donõt extra money .
winning poverty isnõt impossible take plenty time .
one lifetime isnõt enough end make better .
maybe course century , poverty finally history .
author convinced winning fight proverty acheivable lifetime .
author said article told people sick proverty .
kid adult dieing malaria skin .
proverty , people share bed hopsitals without treated .
plant die water fertilizer .
proverty , people buy bed net .
without bed net , kid easily geting bitten mosquito .
bed net , community saved .
sauri , people share bed hopsitales without treated .
proverty , people ca n't treated without proverty people treated .
farmer worry dieing plan .
htey need water fertilizer feed plant .
without proverty , farmer feed family period time .
withour proverty people use bed net , people treated , farmer could feed family .
author convinced winning fight proverty achievable lifetime .
òhelp comingó author first arrived kenya could see poverty around .
think author want kid learn life kenya millenium village project people know life help make big difference todayõs society .
one common dieseases africa malaria .
malaria taking population kid day .
way get malaria since country poor canõt afford .
since malaria spread night mosquito bed net keep people getting malaria .
bed net treated chemical last 5 year bed net cost $ 5 country afford .
another problem millenium village project lack water fertilizer .
family try subsistence farming work .
subsistence farming farmer grows crop meet famalies need .
family plant seed hoping food grow see lack crop fertizer water help crop grow .
kid kenya attend school .
fee school high parent afford .
school minimal supply kid donõt really much work .
also , school provide meal day many kid donõt much energy .
thanks millenium village project , life kenya improving .
bed net used every sleeping site , hospital medicine common dieseases fertilizer seed .
think since people knowledge different way life make big difference .
winning fight poverty achievable life time .
think could donate money people proverty .
could also donate thing like clothes food donõt buy .
could ask people help .
could prize people donate money clothes food .
might something lot people want could something rare .
could ask stores/shops donate money .
people could donate paper , pencil , pen , marker , notebook , school supply people donõt enough money buy school supply .
could also send money school child could go school .
people canõt afford go school would able go school .
could also send doctor could get examined properly .
clinical officer might know he/she .
could also send bunch doctor treat one patient time .
could send bed .
way wonõt share bed somebody .
could also send bed net lot people die easily .
think could win fight proverty lifetime .
way nobody would feel need steal .

also , school child didnõt enough book , pencil , paper .
since child didnõt go school expected help chore house , get firewood , farm , many chore .
many people didnõt lunch , lead low energy = sick .
sick hospital provided medincine free yet medicine common disease like malaria caused mosquitoesõ bite .
kenya bed net helped prevented bite .

much people u help every-body .
people think could eventually happen , think could happen lifetime .
maybe sometime future , could happen though .
also 115 million kid school .
help kid adult , would use lot resource .
donõt think power resource help everybody .
people think make huge difference every poor personõs life .
definately change peopleõs life , everybodyõs .
people think get everyone poverty lifetime .
disagree point view lifetime short .
canõt conjure enough resource money help everyone short period time .
example , took 4 year get small town 200-500 people poverty .
even took lot energy money .
make difference peopleõs life .
canõt get everyone poverty .
many people need help .
also , donõt enough money , people , resource make huge difference .
lifetime short change everyoneõs life , start making change .
everyone pitch little bit .
help change life .
also help make people aware situation .
people donõt know people money .
even though canõt change world , take step change life .
, text state , ò20,000 kid die disease day.ó another statement support mine kid concentrate food .
also , farmer able farm lack fertilizer .
one fact child would run bare foot ground , hurting foot .
making possible make life time adding school fee , providing lunch child , making attendence go .

people world worked together provide water fertilizer farmer , starvation prevented .
also think place lunch school people would donate money pay .

child want tobe school cant even go school kid school walk 2-5 mile get little school supply like book , writing utensil paper child would anything get education
get little none .
hospital care poor usually two adult bed 3 kid bed .
think donate thing like bread fill clean water thing like misquito sorry level malaria getting really high especially tropical area .
also donate seed grow tomato , lettuce , green corn grain , also donating fertilizer try grow plant die nomoney good fertilization .
think would good people sign millinium village project least $ 2 dollar day help towards providing food , treatment clean water .
read formed oppinon .
believe quit pissiable fix entire world , date past 2025 .
one reason think author traveled keny ait mess .
school fee expensive one actually pay , little water , three kid bed hosbitale .
four year later much better , still needed work .
take four-six year fix one small village , take least 10-100x time till done .
fix , n't done .
village , need repaired .
plus recieve 1 $ income daily , need job 's hard sound .
need job , village wild poor state also need hospital .
also send medicine .
author stated people would go hospital might get treated either could n't afford , hospital n't right treatment .
could get sick , could also get attacked hippo , crocodile , wild creature .
hospital income important , place like kenya .
take year help problem one village .
imagine long would take 300 village !
heard village are'nt ahead history u .
village still dirty water , toilet .
would take make sure village clean wwater , good fertalizer , actual toilet .
